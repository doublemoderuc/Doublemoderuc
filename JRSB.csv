This is in contrast with the common claim that the inverse of the observed Fisher information is a better approximation of the variance of the maximum likelihood estimator. Observed Fisher information cannot be knowna priori; however, if an experiment is conducted sequentially, in a series of runs, the observed Fisher information from previous runs is known.

Given a prespecified overall alpha level and power, we derive the optimal alpha spending function that minimizes the expected time to signal for continuous as well as group sequential analysis. If there is also a restriction on the maximum sample size or on the expected sample size, we do the same. Alternatively, for fixed overall alpha, power and expected time to signal, we derive the optimal alpha spending function that minimizes the expected sample size. The method constructs alpha spending functions that are uniformly better than any other method, such as the classical Wald, Pocock or O'Brien-Fleming methods. The results are based on exact calculations using linear programming.

False discovery and its control in low rank estimation,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,Sep-20,"Taeb, A(Taeb, Armeen)[1];Shah, P(Shah, Parikshit)[2,3];Chandrasekaran, V(Chandrasekaran, Venkat)[1]",20,0,"Models specified by low rank matrices are ubiquitous in contemporary applications. In many of these problem domains, the row-column space structure of a low rank matrix carries information about some underlying phenomenon, and it is of interest in inferential settings to evaluate the extent to which the row-column spaces of an estimated low rank matrix signify discoveries about the phenomenon. However, in contrast with variable selection, we lack a formal framework to assess true or false discoveries in low rank estimation; in particular, the key source of difficulty is that the standard notion of a discovery is a discrete notion that is ill suited to the smooth structure underlying low rank matrices. We address this challenge via ageometricreformulation of the concept of a discovery, which then enables a natural definition in the low rank case. We describe and analyse a generalization of the stability selection method of Meinshausen and Buhlmann to control for false discoveries in low rank estimation, and we demonstrate its utility compared with previous approaches via numerical experiments.",Algebraic geometry; Determinantal varieties; Model selection; Regularization; Stability selection; Testing,SELECTION; NUMBER,"['[ 1 ]CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA', '[ 2 ]Yahoo Res, Madison, WI USA', '[ 3 ]Wisconsin Inst Discovery, Madison, WI USA']","['California Institute of Technology', 'California Institute of Technology', 'California Institute of Technology']","['CONTROLLINGTHEFALSEDISCOVERYRATE-APRACTICALANDPOWERFULAPPROACHTOMULTIPLETESTINGBy:BENJAMINI,Y;HOCHBERG,YJOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-STATISTICALMETHODOLOGY Volume: 57Issue: 1Pages: 289-300Published: 1995', 'NUMERICALMETHODSFORCOMPUTINGANGLESBETWEENLINEARSUBSPACESBy:BJORCK,A;GOLUB,GHMATHEMATICSOFCOMPUTATION Volume: 27Issue: 123Pages: 579-594Published: 1973', 'ExactMatrixCompletionviaConvexOptimizationBy:Candes,EmmanuelJ.;Recht,BenjaminFOUNDATIONSOFCOMPUTATIONALMATHEMATICS Volume: 9Issue: 6Pages: 717-772Published: DEC2009', 'LATENTVARIABLEGRAPHICALMODELSELECTIONVIACONVEXOPTIMIZATIONBy:Chandrasekaran,Venkat;Parrilo,PabloA.;Willsky,AlanS.ANNALSOFSTATISTICS Volume: 40Issue: 4Pages: 1935-1967Published: AUG2012', 'SELECTINGTHENUMBEROFPRINCIPALCOMPONENTS:ESTIMATIONOFTHETRUERANKOFANOISYMATRIXBy:Choi,Yunjin;Taylor,Jonathan;Tibshirani,RobertANNALSOFSTATISTICS Volume: 45Issue: 6Pages: 2590-2617Published: DEC2017', 'Reduced-RankSTAPAlgorithmsusingJointIterativeOptimizationofFiltersBy:Fa,Rui;DeLamare,RodrigoC.IEEETRANSACTIONSONAEROSPACEANDELECTRONICSYSTEMS Volume: 47Issue: 3Pages: 1668-1684Published: JUL2011', 'MatrixrankminimizationwithapplicationBy:Fazel,Maryam.THESIS Published: 2002PhDthesisPublisher:Elec.Eng.Dept.,StanfordUniversity', 'USINGCOLLABORATIVEFILTERINGTOWEAVEANINFORMATIONTAPESTRYBy:GOLDBERG,D;NICHOLS,D;OKI,BM;etal.COMMUNICATIONSOFTHEACM Volume: 35Issue: 12Pages: 61-70Published: DEC1992', 'Title:[notavailable]By:Harris,J.AlgebraicGeometryAFirstCourse Published: 1995Publisher:Springer-Verlag', 'TensorDecompositionsandApplicationsBy:Kolda,TamaraG.;Bader,BrettW.SIAMREVIEW Volume: 51Issue: 3Pages: 455-500Published: SEP2009', 'INTERIOR-POINTMETHODFORNUCLEARNORMAPPROXIMATIONWITHAPPLICATIONTOSYSTEMIDENTIFICATIONBy:Liu,Zhang;Vandenberghe,LievenSIAMJOURNALONMATRIXANALYSISANDAPPLICATIONS Volume: 31Issue: 3Pages: 1235-1256Published: 2009', 'AGeometricPerspectiveonthePowerofPrincipalComponentAssociationTestsinMultiplePhenotypeStudiesBy:Liu,Zhonghua;Lin,XihongJOURNALOFTHEAMERICANSTATISTICALASSOCIATION Volume: 114Issue: 527Pages: 975-990Published: JUL32019', 'Detectionalgorithmsforhyperspectralimagingapplications:AsignalprocessingperspectiveBy:Manolakis,DConference:IEEEWorkshoponAdvancesinTechniquesforAnalysisofRemotelySensedDataheldinHonorofDavidALandgrebeLocation: NASAGoddardSpaceFlightVisitorCtr,Greenbelt,MDDate: OCT27-28,2003Sponsor(s): IEEE2003IEEEWORKSHOPONADVANCESINTECHNIQUESFORANALYSISOFREMOTELYSENSEDDATA Pages: 378-384Published: 2004', 'StabilityselectionBy:Meinshausen,Nicolai;Buehlmann,PeterJOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-STATISTICALMETHODOLOGY Volume: 72Pages: 417-473Part: 4Published: 2010', 'PHASE-SHIFTINGMASKSFORMICROLITHOGRAPHY-AUTOMATEDDESIGNANDMASKREQUIREMENTSBy:PATI,YC;KAILATH,TJOURNALOFTHEOPTICALSOCIETYOFAMERICAA-OPTICSIMAGESCIENCEANDVISION Volume: 11Issue: 9Pages: 2438-2452Published: SEP1994', 'Variableselectionwitherrorcontrol:anotherlookatstabilityselectionBy:Shah,RajenD.;Samworth,RichardJ.JOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-STATISTICALMETHODOLOGY Volume: 75Issue: 1Pages: 55-80Published: 2013', 'WEIGHTEDMINIMUMTRACEFACTOR-ANALYSISBy:SHAPIRO,APSYCHOMETRIKA Volume: 47Issue: 3Pages: 243-264Published: 1982', 'StabilityapproachtoselectingthenumberofprincipalcomponentsBy:Song,Jiyeon;Shin,SeungJunCOMPUTATIONALSTATISTICS Volume: 33Issue: 4Pages: 1923-1938Published: DEC2018', 'Rank,trace-normandmax-normBy:Srebro,N;Shraibman,AConference:18thAnnualConferenceonLearningTheory(COLT2005)Location: Bertinoro,ITALYDate: JUN27-30,2005Sponsor(s): MachineLearningJournal;Google;BertinoroIntCtrInformat;PASCAL;UnivStudiMilanoLEARNINGTHEORY,PROCEEDINGS BookSeries: LectureNotesinComputerScienceVolume: 3559Pages: 545-560Published: 2005', 'Title:[notavailable]By:Toh,K.C.;Todd,M.J.;Tutuncu,R.H.SDPT3-aMATLABsoftwarepackageforsemidefinite-quadratic-linearprogramming Published: 2006URL:http://fhya3f1dd94801084b908800a12bbd3d331chvob0puf0ucpn6xn6.fbzz.libproxy.ruc.edu.cn/mattohkc/sdpt3.html']",10.1111/rssb.12387

Such 'points of impact' are typically unknown and must be estimated in addition to estimating the usual model components. We show that our points-of-impact estimator enjoys a superconsistent rate of convergence and does not require knowledge or pre-estimates of the unknown model components. This remarkable result facilitates the subsequent estimation of the remaining model components as shown in the theoretical part, where we consider the case of non-parametric models and the practically relevant case of generalized linear models. The finite sample properties of our estimators are assessed by means of a simulation study.

Graphical models for extremes,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,Sep-20,"Engelke, S(Engelke, Sebastian)[1];Hitz, AS(Hitz, Adrien S.)[2,3]",85,2,"Conditional independence, graphical models and sparsity are key notions for parsimonious statistical models and for understanding the structural relationships in the data. The theory of multivariate and spatial extremes describes the risk of rare events through asymptotically justified limit models such as max-stable and multivariate Pareto distributions. Statistical modelling in this field has been limited to moderate dimensions so far, partly owing to complicated likelihoods and a lack of understanding of the underlying probabilistic structures. We introduce a general theory of conditional independence for multivariate Pareto distributions that enables the definition of graphical models and sparsity for extremes. A Hammersley-Clifford theorem links this new notion to the factorization of densities of extreme value models on graphs. For the popular class of Husler-Reiss distributions we show that, similarly to the Gaussian case, the sparsity pattern of a general extremal graphical model can be read off from suitable inverse covariance matrices. New parametric models can be built in a modular way and statistical inference can be simplified to lower dimensional marginals. We discuss learning of minimum spanning trees and model selection for extremal graph structures, and we illustrate their use with an application to flood risk assessment on the Danube river.",Conditional independence; Extreme value theory; Graphical models; Multivariate Pareto distribution; Sparsity,MAX-STABLE PROCESSES; CONDITIONAL-INDEPENDENCE; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; TAIL DEPENDENCE; MARKOV-CHAIN; M-ESTIMATOR; MULTIVARIATE; SIMULATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; PROBABILITY,"['[ 1 ]Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland', '[ 2 ]Univ Oxford, Oxford, England', '[ 3 ]Materialize X, London, England']","['University of Geneva', 'University of Geneva', 'University of Geneva', 'University of Oxford']","['AnewrandomizedresponsemodelBy:Gjestvang,ChristopherR.;Singh,SarjinderJOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-STATISTICALMETHODOLOGY Volume: 68Pages: 523-530Part: 3Published: 2006', ""Correction:'Anewrandomizedresponsemodel'By:Grover,LovleenKumar;Kaur,AmanpreetJOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-STATISTICALMETHODOLOGY Volume: 82Issue: 1Pages: 269-271Published: FEB2020EarlyAccess:OCT2019EarlyAccessEarlyaccessarearticlesthathavebeenpeer-reviewedandacceptedforpublication.Thearticlecontenthasbeenfinalized,butithasnotbeenassignedtoanissueyet.Duringthisstageofpublication,somejournalsprovideearlyaccesstoarticlessothattheymaybereadandcited.Onceassignedtoanissue,thisrecordwillbeupdatedtoincludethefullcitation.Citationstothisarticlewillbeaggregatedregardlessofthestageofpublication."", 'ANALTERNATIVERANDOMIZED-RESPONSEPROCEDUREBy:MANGAT,NS;SINGH,RBIOMETRIKA Volume: 77Issue: 2Pages: 439-442Published: JUN1990', 'ANIMPROVEDRANDOMIZED-RESPONSESTRATEGYBy:MANGAT,NSJOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-METHODOLOGICAL Volume: 56Issue: 1Pages: 93-95Published: 1994', 'RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE-ASURVEYTECHNIQUEFORELIMINATINGEVASIVEANSWERBIAS(ViewrecordinMEDLINE)By:WARNER,SLJOURNALOFTHEAMERICANSTATISTICALASSOCIATION Volume: 60Issue: 309Pages: 63-69Published: 1965', 'AnewrandomizedresponsemodelBy:Gjestvang,ChristopherR.;Singh,SarjinderJOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-STATISTICALMETHODOLOGY Volume: 68Pages: 523-530Part: 3Published: 2006', ""Correction:'Anewrandomizedresponsemodel'By:Grover,LovleenKumar;Kaur,AmanpreetJOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-STATISTICALMETHODOLOGY Volume: 82Issue: 1Pages: 269-271Published: FEB2020EarlyAccess:OCT2019EarlyAccessEarlyaccessarearticlesthathavebeenpeer-reviewedandacceptedforpublication.Thearticlecontenthasbeenfinalized,butithasnotbeenassignedtoanissueyet.Duringthisstageofpublication,somejournalsprovideearlyaccesstoarticlessothattheymaybereadandcited.Onceassignedtoanissue,thisrecordwillbeupdatedtoincludethefullcitation.Citationstothisarticlewillbeaggregatedregardlessofthestageofpublication."", 'ANALTERNATIVERANDOMIZED-RESPONSEPROCEDUREBy:MANGAT,NS;SINGH,RBIOMETRIKA Volume: 77Issue: 2Pages: 439-442Published: JUN1990', 'ANIMPROVEDRANDOMIZED-RESPONSESTRATEGYBy:MANGAT,NSJOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-METHODOLOGICAL Volume: 56Issue: 1Pages: 93-95Published: 1994', 'RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE-ASURVEYTECHNIQUEFORELIMINATINGEVASIVEANSWERBIAS(ViewrecordinMEDLINE)By:WARNER,SLJOURNALOFTHEAMERICANSTATISTICALASSOCIATION Volume: 60Issue: 309Pages: 63-69Published: 1965', 'AnewrandomizedresponsemodelBy:Gjestvang,ChristopherR.;Singh,SarjinderJOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-STATISTICALMETHODOLOGY Volume: 68Pages: 523-530Part: 3Published: 2006', ""Correction:'Anewrandomizedresponsemodel'By:Grover,LovleenKumar;Kaur,AmanpreetJOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-STATISTICALMETHODOLOGY Volume: 82Issue: 1Pages: 269-271Published: FEB2020EarlyAccess:OCT2019EarlyAccessEarlyaccessarearticlesthathavebeenpeer-reviewedandacceptedforpublication.Thearticlecontenthasbeenfinalized,butithasnotbeenassignedtoanissueyet.Duringthisstageofpublication,somejournalsprovideearlyaccesstoarticlessothattheymaybereadandcited.Onceassignedtoanissue,thisrecordwillbeupdatedtoincludethefullcitation.Citationstothisarticlewillbeaggregatedregardlessofthestageofpublication."", 'ANALTERNATIVERANDOMIZED-RESPONSEPROCEDUREBy:MANGAT,NS;SINGH,RBIOMETRIKA Volume: 77Issue: 2Pages: 439-442Published: JUN1990', 'ANIMPROVEDRANDOMIZED-RESPONSESTRATEGYBy:MANGAT,NSJOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-METHODOLOGICAL Volume: 56Issue: 1Pages: 93-95Published: 1994', 'RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE-ASURVEYTECHNIQUEFORELIMINATINGEVASIVEANSWERBIAS(ViewrecordinMEDLINE)By:WARNER,SLJOURNALOFTHEAMERICANSTATISTICALASSOCIATION Volume: 60Issue: 309Pages: 63-69Published: 1965']",10.1111/rssb.12355
Quasi-Bayes properties of a procedure for sequential learning in mixture models,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,Sep-20,"Fortini, S(Fortini, Sandra)[1];Petrone, S(Petrone, Sonia)[1]",42,0,"Bayesian methods are often optimal, yet increasing pressure for fast computations, especially with streaming data, brings renewed interest in faster, possibly suboptimal, solutions. The extent to which these algorithms approximate Bayesian solutions is a question of interest, but often unanswered. We propose a methodology to address this question in predictive settings, when the algorithm can be reinterpreted as a probabilistic predictive rule. We specifically develop the proposed methodology for a recursive procedure for on-line learning in non-parametric mixture models, which is often referred to as Newton's algorithm. This algorithm is simple and fast; however, its approximation properties are unclear. By reinterpreting it as a predictive rule, we can show that it underlies a statistical model which is, asymptotically, a Bayesian, exchangeable mixture model. In this sense, the recursive rule provides a quasi-Bayes solution. Although the algorithm offers only a point estimate, our clean statistical formulation enables us to provide the asymptotic posterior distribution and asymptotic credible intervals for the mixing distribution. Moreover, it gives insights for tuning the parameters, as we illustrate in simulation studies, and paves the way to extensions in various directions. Beyond mixture models, our approach can be applied to other predictive algorithms.",Asymptotic exchangeability; Bayesian non-parametrics; Conditionally identically distributed sequences; Dirichlet

A scalable estimate of the out-of-sample prediction error via approximate leave-one-out cross-validation,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,Sep-20,"Rad, KR(Rad, Kamiar Rahnama)[1];Maleki, A(Maleki, Arian)[2]",87,0,"The paper considers the problem of out-of-sample risk estimation under the high dimensional settings where standard techniques such asK-fold cross-validation suffer from large biases. Motivated by the low bias of the leave-one-out cross-validation method, we propose a computationally efficient closed form approximate leave-one-out formula ALO for a large class of regularized estimators. Given the regularized estimate, calculating ALO requires a minor computational overhead. With minor assumptions about the data-generating process, we obtain a finite sample upper bound for the difference between leave-one-out cross-validation and approximate leave-one-out cross-validation, |LO-ALO|. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that |LO-ALO|-> 0 with overwhelming probability, whenn,p ->infinity, where the dimensionpof the feature vectors may be comparable with or even greater than the number of observations,n. Despite the high dimensionality of the problem, our theoretical results do not require any sparsity assumption on the vector of regression coefficients. Our extensive numerical experiments show that |LO-ALO| decreases asnandpincrease, revealing the excellent finite sample performance of approximate leave-one-out cross-validation. We further illustrate the usefulness of our proposed out-of-sample risk estimation method by an example of real recordings from spatially sensitive neurons (grid cells) in the medial entorhinal cortex of a rat.",Cross-validation; Generalized linear models; High dimensional statistics; Out-of-sample risk estimation; Regularized estimation,ROBUST REGRESSION; VARIABLE SELECTION; RANDOMIZED GCV; MODEL; LASSO; REGULARIZATION; INFERENCE; FREEDOM; CHOICE; MAP,"['[ 1 ]CUNY, New York, NY 10021 USA', '[ 2 ]Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA']","['City University of New York (CUNY) System', 'Baruch College (CUNY)', 'City University of New York (CUNY) System', 'Baruch College (CUNY)', 'City University of New York (CUNY) System', 'Columbia University']",[],10.1111/rssb.12374
A unified data-adaptive framework for high dimensional change point detection,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,Sep-20,"Liu, B(Liu, Bin)[1];Zhou, C(Zhou, Cheng)[2];Zhang, XS(Zhang, Xinsheng)[1];Liu, YF(Liu, Yufeng)[3]",44,0,"In recent years, change point detection for a high dimensional data sequence has become increasingly important in many scientific fields such as biology and finance. The existing literature develops a variety of methods designed for either a specified parameter (e.g. the mean or covariance) or a particular alternative pattern (sparse or dense), but not for both scenarios simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we provide a general framework for developing tests that are suitable for a large class of parameters, and also adaptive to various alternative scenarios. In particular, by generalizing the classical cumulative sum statistic, we construct theU-statistic-based cumulative sum matrixC. Two cases corresponding to common or different change point locations across the components are considered. We then propose two types of individual test statistics by aggregatingCon the basis of the adjustedL(p)-norm withp is an element of {1, horizontal ellipsis ,infinity}. Combining the corresponding individual tests, we construct two types of data-adaptive tests for the two cases, which are both powerful under various alternative patterns. A multiplier bootstrap method is introduced for approximating the proposed test statistics' limiting distributions. With flexible dependence structure across co-ordinates and mild moment conditions, we show the optimality of our methods theoretically in terms of size and power by allowing the dimensiondand the number of parametersqto be much larger than the sample sizen. An R package called AdaptiveCpt is developed to implement our algorithms. Extensive simulation studies provide further support for our theory.

A shortcoming of black box supervised learning models (e.g. complex trees, neural networks, boosted trees, random forests, nearest neighbours, local kernel-weighted methods and support vector regression) in this regard is their lack of interpretability or transparency. Partial dependence plots, which are the most popular approach for visualizing the effects of the predictors with black box supervised learning models, can produce erroneous results if the predictors are strongly correlated, because they require extrapolation of the response at predictor values that are far outside the multivariate envelope of the training data. As an alternative to partial dependence plots, we present a new visualization approach that we term accumulated local effects plots, which do not require this unreliable extrapolation with correlated predictors. Moreover, accumulated local effects plots are far less computationally expensive than partial dependence plots.

A flexible framework for hypothesis testing in high dimensions,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,Jul-20,"Javanmard, A(Javanmard, Adel)[1];Lee, JD(Lee, Jason D.)[2]",65,0,"Hypothesis testing in the linear regression model is a fundamental statistical problem. We consider linear regression in the high dimensional regime where the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples (p>n). To make informative inference, we assume that the model is approximately sparse, i.e. the effect of covariates on the response can be well approximated by conditioning on a relatively small number of covariates whose identities are unknown. We develop a framework for testing very general hypotheses regarding the model parameters. Our framework encompasses testing whether the parameter lies in a convex cone, testing the signal strength, and testing arbitrary functionals of the parameter. We show that the procedure proposed controls the type I error, and we also analyse the power of the procedure. Our numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate that we control the false positive rate (type I error) near the nominal level and have high power. By duality between hypotheses testing and confidence intervals, the framework proposed can be used to obtain valid confidence intervals for various functionals of the model parameters.

Our framework is flexible and may be used to construct an omnibus test or directed against testing specific non-linearities and interaction effects, or for testing the significance of groups of variables. The methodology is based on extracting left-over signal in the residuals from an initial fit of a generalized linear model. This can be achieved by predicting this signal from the residuals by using modern powerful regression or machine learning methods such as random forests or boosted trees. Under the null hypothesis that the generalized linear model is correct, no signal is left in the residuals and our test statistic has a Gaussian limiting distribution, translating to asymptotic control of type I error. Under a local alternative, we establish a guarantee on the power of the test. We illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology on simulated and real data examples by testing goodness of fit in logistic regression models.

Causal isotonic regression,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,Jul-20,"Westling, T(Westling, Ted)[1];Gilbert, P(Gilbert, Peter)[2];Carone, M(Carone, Marco)[3]",48,0,"In observational studies, potential confounders may distort the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome. However, under some conditions, a causal dose-response curve can be recovered by using the G-computation formula. Most classical methods for estimating such curves when the exposure is continuous rely on restrictive parametric assumptions, which carry significant risk of model misspecification. Non-parametric estimation in this context is challenging because in a non-parametric model these curves cannot be estimated at regular rates. Many available non-parametric estimators are sensitive to the selection of certain tuning parameters, and performing valid inference with such estimators can be difficult. We propose a non-parametric estimator of a causal dose-response curve known to be monotone. We show that our proposed estimation procedure generalizes the classical least squares isotonic regression estimator of a monotone regression function. Specifically, it does not involve tuning parameters and is invariant to strictly monotone transformations of the exposure variable. We describe theoretical properties of our proposed estimator, including its irregular limit distribution and the potential for doubly robust inference. Furthermore, we illustrate its performance via numerical studies and use it to assess the relationship between body mass index and immune response in human immunodeficiency virus vaccine trials.",Backdoor formula; Cross-fitting; Dose-response; Grenander-type estimator; Monotonicity; Shape-constrained estimation,DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATION; INFERENCE; IMMUNOGENICITY; OBESITY,"['[ 1 ]Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA', '[ 2 ]Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, 1124 Columbia St, Seattle, WA 98104 USA', '[ 3 ]Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA']","['University of Massachusetts System', 'University of Massachusetts Amherst', 'University of Massachusetts System', 'University of Massachusetts Amherst', 'University of Massachusetts System', 'University of Massachusetts Amherst', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center', 'University of Washington', 'University of Washington Seattle']",[],10.1111/rssb.12372

Existing quasi-likelihood methods for testing in misspecified models often do not provide satisfactory type I error rate control. We provide a novel semiparametric test, based on sign flipping individual score contributions. The parameter tested is allowed to be multi-dimensional and even high dimensional. Our test is often robust against the mentioned forms of misspecification and provides better type I error control than its competitors. When nuisance parameters are estimated, our basic test becomes conservative. We show how to take nuisance estimation into account to obtain an asymptotically exact test.

Instead of testing for exact equality, e.g. for the equality of two mean functions from two independent time series, we propose to test the null hypothesis of no relevant deviation. In the two-sample problem this means that an L2-distance between the two mean functions is smaller than a prespecified threshold. For such hypotheses self-normalization, which was introduced in 2010 by Shao, and Shao and Zhang and is commonly used to avoid the estimation of nuisance parameters, is not directly applicable. We develop new self-normalized procedures for testing relevant hypotheses in the one-sample, two-sample and change point problem and investigate their asymptotic properties. Finite sample properties of the tests proposed are illustrated by means of a simulation study and data examples.

The resulting unbiased estimators can be computed independently in parallel. We discuss practical couplings for popular MCMC algorithms.

To produce reliable estimators with associated confidence intervals, some basic statistical properties like consistency and asymptotic normality of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator are desirable, along with the consistency of associated variance estimators. These properties have been mainly studied for single-stage sampling designs. In this work, we prove the consistency of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator and of associated variance estimators for a general class of two-stage sampling designs, under mild assumptions. We also study two-stage sampling with a large entropy sampling design at the first stage and prove that the Horvitz-Thompson estimator is asymptotically normally distributed through a coupling argument.

The paper investigates the choice of adaptive and non-adaptive bandwidths for density estimation given data on a spatial lattice. An adaptive bandwidth depends on local data and hence adaptively conforms with local features of the spatial data. We propose a spatial cross-validation (SCV) choice of a global bandwidth. This is done first with a pilot density involved in the expression for the adaptive bandwidth. The optimality of the procedure is established, and it is shown that a non-adaptive bandwidth choice comes out as a special case. Although the cross-validation idea has been popular for choosing a non-adaptive bandwidth in data-driven smoothing of independent and time series data, its theory and application have not been much investigated for spatial data. For the adaptive case, there is little theory even for independent data. Conditions that ensure asymptotic optimality of the SCV-selected bandwidth are derived, actually, also extending time series and independent data optimality results. Further, for the adaptive bandwidth with an estimated pilot density, oracle properties of the resultant density estimator are obtained asymptotically as if the true pilot were known. Numerical simulations show that finite sample performance of the SCV adaptive bandwidth choice works quite well. It outperforms the existing R routines such as the 'rule of thumb' and the so-called 'second-generation' Sheather-Jones bandwidths for moderate and big data sets.

Functional models for time-varying random objects,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,Apr-20,"Dubey, P(Dubey, Paromita)[1];Muller, HG(Mueller, Hans-Georg)[1]",72,0,"Functional data analysis provides a popular toolbox of functional models for the analysis of samples of random functions that are real valued. In recent years, samples of time-varying object data such as time-varying networks that are not in a vector space have been increasingly collected. These data can be viewed as elements of a general metric space that lacks local or global linear structure and therefore common approaches that have been used with great success for the analysis of functional data, such as functional principal component analysis, cannot be applied. We propose metric covariance, a novel association measure for paired object data lying in a metric space (omega,d) that we use to define a metric autocovariance function for a sample of random omega-valued curves, where omega generally will not have a vector space or manifold structure. The proposed metric autocovariance function is non-negative definite when the squared semimetric d(2) is of negative type. Then the eigenfunctions of the linear operator with the autocovariance function as kernel can be used as building blocks for an object functional principal component analysis for omega-valued functional data, including time-varying probability distributions, covariance matrices and time dynamic networks. Analogues of functional principal components for time-varying objects are obtained by applying Frechet means and projections of distance functions of the random object trajectories in the directions of the eigenfunctions, leading to real-valued Frechet scores. Using the notion of generalized Frechet integrals, we construct object functional principal components that lie in the metric space omega. We establish asymptotic consistency of the sample-based estimators for the corresponding population targets under mild metric entropy conditions on omega and continuity of the omega-valued random curves.

We propose a simple and scalable estimator based on the projection onto the right singular vectors of the observed data matrix, which we call right singular vector projection (RSVP). Our theoretical analysis of this method reveals that, in contrast with approaches based on the removal of principal components, RSVP can cope well with settings where the smallest eigenvalue of Gamma T Gamma is relatively close to the largest eigenvalue of sigma, as well as when the eigenvalues of Gamma T Gamma are diverging fast. RSVP does not require knowledge or estimation of the number of latent factors q, but it recovers sigma only up to an unknown positive scale factor. We argue that this suffices in many applications, e.g. if an estimate of the correlation matrix is desired.

By crawling the graph in a designed way, the PPR vector can be approximated without querying the entire massive graph, making it an alternative to snowball sampling. Using the degree-corrected stochastic block model, we study whether the PPR vector can select nodes that belong to the same block as the seed node. We provide a simple and interpretable form for the PPR vector, highlighting its biases towards high degree nodes outside the target block. We examine a simple adjustment based on node degrees and establish consistency results for PPR clustering that allows for directed graphs. These results are enabled by recent technical advances showing the elementwise convergence of eigenvectors.

Rerandomization and regression adjustment,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,Feb-20,"Li, XR(Li, Xinran)[1];Ding, P(Ding, Peng)[2]",54,1,"Randomization is a basis for the statistical inference of treatment effects without strong assumptions on the outcome-generating process. Appropriately using covariates further yields more precise estimators in randomized experiments. R. A. Fisher suggested blocking on discrete covariates in the design stage or conducting analysis of covariance in the analysis stage. We can embed blocking in a wider class of experimental design called rerandomization, and extend the classical analysis of covariance to more general regression adjustment. Rerandomization trumps complete randomization in the design stage, and regression adjustment trumps the simple difference-in-means estimator in the analysis stage. It is then intuitive to use both rerandomization and regression adjustment. Under the randomization inference framework, we establish a unified theory allowing the designer and analyser to have access to different sets of covariates. We find that asymptotically, for any given estimator with or without regression adjustment, rerandomization never hurts either the sampling precision or the estimated precision, and, for any given design with or without rerandomization, our regression-adjusted estimator never hurts the estimated precision. Therefore, combining rerandomization and regression adjustment yields better coverage properties and thus improves statistical inference. To quantify these statements theoretically, we discuss optimal regression-adjusted estimators in terms of the sampling precision and the estimated precision, and then measure the additional gains of the designer and the analyser.

When the parameter of interest is the distribution or density of a continuous variable, a hierarchical model for continuous distributions is required. Various such models have been described in the literature using extensions of the Dirichlet process and related processes, typically as a distribution on the parameters of a mixing kernel. We propose a new hierarchical model based on the Polya tree, which enables direct modelling of densities and enjoys some computational advantages over the Dirichlet process. The Polya tree also enables more flexible modelling of the variation between samples, providing more informed shrinkage and permitting posterior inference on the dispersion function, which quantifies the variation between sample densities.

This new type of indirect effect captures the extent to which the effect of exposure is mediated by an intermediate variable under an intervention that holds the component of exposure directly influencing the outcome at its observed value. The population intervention indirect effect is in fact the indirect component of the population intervention effect, introduced by Hubbard and Van der Laan.

Here, we develop a general approach for valid inference following selection by aggregate testing. We present novel powerful post-selection tests for the individual null hypotheses which are exact for the normal model and asymptotically justified otherwise. Our approach relies on the ability to characterize the distribution of the individual test statistics after conditioning on the event of selection. We provide efficient algorithms for computation of the post-selection maximum likelihood estimates and suggest confidence intervals which rely on a novel switching regime for good coverage guarantees.

A general asymptotic framework for distribution-free graph-based two-sample tests,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,Jul-19,"Bhattacharya, BB(Bhattacharya, Bhaswar B.)[1]",43,1,"Testing equality of two multivariate distributions is a classical problem for which many non-parametric tests have been proposed over the years. Most of the popular two-sample tests, which are asymptotically distribution free, are based either on geometric graphs constructed by using interpoint distances between the observations (multivariate generalizations of the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test) or on multivariate data depth (generalizations of the Mann-Whitney rank test). The paper introduces a general notion of distribution-free graph-based two-sample tests and provides a unified framework for analysing and comparing their asymptotic properties. The asymptotic (Pitman) efficiency of a general graph-based test is derived, which includes tests based on geometric graphs, such as the Friedman-Rafsky test, the test based on the K-nearest-neighbour graph, the cross-match test and the generalized edge count test, as well as tests based on multivariate depth functions (the Liu-Singh rank sum statistic). The results show how the combinatorial properties of the underlying graph affect the performance of the associated two-sample test and can be used to validate and decide which tests to use in practice.

Here we introduce the structure-adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg algorithm' (SABHA) as a generalization of these adaptive testing methods. The SABHA method incorporates prior information about any predetermined type of structure in the pattern of locations of the signals and nulls within the list of hypotheses, to reweight the p-values in a data-adaptive way. This raises the power by making more discoveries in regions where signals appear to be more common. Our main theoretical result proves that the SABHA method controls the FDR at a level that is at most slightly higher than the target FDR level, as long as the adaptive weights are constrained sufficiently so as not to overfit too much to the datainterestingly, the excess FDR can be related to the Rademacher complexity or Gaussian width of the class from which we choose our data-adaptive weights.

This work is to fill the gap: we propose a general algorithm for high dimensional missing data problems. The algorithm works by iterating between an imputation step and a regularized optimization step. At the imputation step, the missing data are imputed conditionally on the observed data and the current estimates of parameters and, at the regularized optimization step, a consistent estimate is found via the regularization approach for the minimizer of a Kullback-Leibler divergence defined on the pseudocomplete data. For high dimensional problems, the consistent estimate can be found under sparsity constraints. The consistency of the averaged estimate for the true parameter can be established under quite general conditions.

In short, when using a weighted difference in means to estimate the sample average treatment effect, the traditional variance estimator in a paired experiment is conservative unless the pairwise average treatment effects are constant across pairs; however, in more coarsely stratified experiments, the corresponding variance estimator is unbiased if treatment effects are constant within blocks, even if they vary across blocks. Using insights from classical least squares theory, we present an improved variance estimator that is appropriate in finely stratified experiments. The variance estimator remains conservative in expectation but is asymptotically no more conservative than the classical estimator and can be considerably less conservative. The magnitude of the improvement depends on the extent to which effect heterogeneity can be explained by observed covariates. Aided by this estimator, a new test for the null hypothesis of a constant treatment effect is proposed.

For example, biomedical outcomes are often highly asymmetric, and median regression is more useful in describing the central' behaviour than mean regressions. There are also cases where the research interest is to study the high or low quantiles of a population, as they are more likely to be at risk.

We develop a method for debiasing penalized regression adjustments to allow sparse regression methods like the lasso to be used for root n-consistent inference of average treatment effects in high dimensional linear models.

It is well known that, when the graph G is decomposable, Bayesian inference is significantly more tractable than in the general non-decomposable setting. Penalized likelihood inference in contrast has made tremendous gains in the past few years in terms of scalability and tractability. Bayesian inference, however, has not had the same level of success, though a scalable Bayesian approach has its strengths, especially in terms of quantifying uncertainty. To address this gap, we propose a scalable and flexible novel Bayesian approach for estimation and model selection in Gaussian undirected graphical models. We first develop a class of generalized G-Wishart distributions with multiple shape parameters for an arbitrary underlying graph. This class contains the G-Wishart distribution as a special case. We then introduce the class of generalized Bartlett graphs and derive an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm to obtain posterior draws from generalized G-Wishart distributions corresponding to a generalized Bartlett graph. The class of generalized Bartlett graphs contains the class of decomposable graphs as a special case but is substantially larger than the class of decomposable graphs. We proceed to derive theoretical properties of the proposed Gibbs sampler. We then demonstrate that the proposed Gibbs sampler is scalable to significantly higher dimensional problems compared with using an accept-reject or a Metropolis-Hasting algorithm. Finally, we show the efficacy of the proposed approach on simulated and real data.

We prove that marginal samplers are superior in terms of asymptotic variance and demonstrate cases where they are slower in computing time compared with auxiliary samplers.

Although this modelling problem has been extensively studied, it remains unclear how to control the fraction of false discoveries effectively even in high dimensional logistic regression, not to mention general high dimensional non-linear models. To address such a practical problem, we propose a new framework of model-X' knockoffs, which reads from a different perspective the knockoff procedure that was originally designed for controlling the false discovery rate in linear models. Whereas the knockoffs procedure is constrained to homoscedastic linear models with np, the key innovation here is that model-X knockoffs provide valid inference from finite samples in settings in which the conditional distribution of the response is arbitrary and completely unknown. Furthermore, this holds no matter the number of covariates. Correct inference in such a broad setting is achieved by constructing knockoff variables probabilistically instead of geometrically. To do this, our approach requires that the covariates are random (independent and identically distributed rows) with a distribution that is known, although we provide preliminary experimental evidence that our procedure is robust to unknown or estimated distributions. To our knowledge, no other procedure solves the controlled variable selection problem in such generality but, in the restricted settings where competitors exist, we demonstrate the superior power of knockoffs through simulations.

Optimal a priori balance in the design of controlled experiments,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,10.1111/rssb.12240,"Kallus, N(Kallus, Nathan)[1]",53,9,"We develop a unified theory of designs for controlled experiments that balance baseline covariates a priori (before treatment and before randomization) using the framework of minimax variance and a new method called kernel allocation.

Restricting the structure of dependence, either parametrically or non-parametrically, gives rise to certain covariate imbalance metrics and optimal designs. This recovers many popular imbalance metrics and designs previously developed ad hoc, including randomized block designs, pairwise-matched allocation and rerandomization. We develop a new design method called kernel allocation based on the optimal design when structure is expressed by using kernels, which can be parametric or non-parametric.

The novelty of the method lies on the fact that no discretization error is involved despite the non-tractability of the likelihood function and infinite dimensionality of the problem. The method is based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that samples from the joint posterior distribution of the parameters and latent variables of the model. A particular choice of the dominating measure to obtain the likelihood function is shown to be crucial to devise a valid Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The models are defined in a general and flexible way but they are amenable to direct sampling from the relevant distributions because of careful characterization of its components.

To analyse EP, we first introduce a variant of EP: averaged EP, which operates on a smaller parameter space. We then consider averaged EP and EP in the limit of infinite data, where the overall contribution of each likelihood term is small and where posteriors are almost Gaussian. In this limit, we prove that the iterations of both averaged EP and EP are simple: they behave like iterations of Newton's algorithm for finding the mode of a function. We use this limit behaviour to prove that EP is asymptotically exact, and to obtain other insights into the dynamic behaviour of EP, e.g. that it may diverge under poor initialization exactly like Newton's method.

We explore using completely random measures (CRMs) to define the exchangeable random measure, and we show how our CRM construction enables us to achieve sparse graphs while maintaining the attractive properties of exchangeability. We relate the sparsity of the graph to the Levy measure defining the CRM. For a specific choice of CRM, our graphs can be tuned from dense to sparse on the basis of a single parameter.

Here, we combine those two approaches by proposing quantile-based spectral methods for locally stationary processes.

We derive a novel procedure for this, which is asymptotically correct when the covariates are multivariate Gaussian and produces valid confidence intervals in finite samples as well. The procedure, called EigenPrism, is computationally fast and makes no assumptions on coefficient sparsity or knowledge of the noise level. We investigate the width of the EigenPrism confidence intervals, including a comparison with a Bayesian setting in which our interval is just 5% wider than the Bayes credible interval. We are then able to unify the three aforementioned problems by showing that EigenPrism with only minor modifications can make important contributions to all three.

Incorporating correlation information in approximating the false discovery proportion (FDP) has attracted increasing attention in recent years. When the covariance matrix of test statistics is known, Fan and his colleagues provided an accurate approximation of the FDP under arbitrary dependence structure and some sparsity assumption. However, the covariance matrix is often unknown in many applications and such dependence information must be estimated before approximating the FDP. The estimation accuracy can greatly affect the FDP approximation. In the current paper, we study theoretically the effect of unknown dependence on the testing procedure and establish a general framework such that the FDP can be well approximated. The effects of unknown dependence on approximating the FDP are in the following two major aspects: through estimating eigenvalues or eigenvectors and through estimating marginal variances. To address the challenges in these two aspects, we firstly develop general requirements on estimates of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a good approximation of the FDP. We then give conditions on the structures of covariance matrices that satisfy such requirements. Such dependence structures include banded or sparse covariance matrices and (conditional) sparse precision matrices. Within this framework, we also consider a special example to illustrate our method where data are sampled from an approximate factor model, which encompasses most practical situations. We provide a good approximation of the FDP via exploiting this specific dependence structure.

We introduce the p-filter, which takes as input a list of n p-values and M >= 1 partitions of hypotheses, and produces as output a list of n or fewer discoveries such that the group FDR is provably simultaneously controlled for all partitions. Importantly, since the partitions are arbitrary, our procedure can also handle multiple partitions which are non-hierarchical. The p-filter generalizes two classical procedures-when M=1, choosing the finest partition into n singletons, we exactly recover the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, whereas, choosing instead the coarsest partition with a single group of size n, we exactly recover the Simes test for the global null hypothesis. We verify our findings with simulations that show how this technique can not only lead to the aforementioned multilayer FDR control but also lead to improved precision of rejected hypotheses.

There is increasing interest in finding optimal treatment regimes, which determine treatment at one or more treatment decision points to maximize expected long-term clinical outcomes, where larger outcomes are preferred. For chronic diseases such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus infection, survival time is often the outcome of interest, and the goal is to select treatment to maximize survival probability. We propose two non-parametric estimators for the survival function of patients following a given treatment regime involving one or more decisions, i.e. the so-called value. On the basis of data from a clinical or observational study, we estimate an optimal regime by maximizing these estimators for the value over a prespecified class of regimes. Because the value function is very jagged, we introduce kernel smoothing within the estimator to improve performance.

In parallel with the analysis of observational studies, we provide a theoretical foundation for conducting objective causal inference with an intermediate variable under the principal stratification framework, with principal strata defined as the joint potential values of the intermediate variable. Our strategy constructs weighted samples based on principal scores, defined as the conditional probabilities of the latent principal strata given covariates, without access to any outcome data.

To address this problem, procedures based on quantile regression and least absolute deviation regression have been developed in recent years. These methods essentially estimate the conditional median (or quantile) function. They can be very different from the conditional mean functions, especially when distributions are asymmetric and heteroscedastic. How can we efficiently estimate the mean regression functions in ultrahigh dimensional settings with existence of only the second moment? To solve this problem, we propose a penalized Huber loss with diverging parameter to reduce biases created by the traditional Huber loss. Such a penalized robust approximate (RA) quadratic loss will be called the RA lasso. In the ultrahigh dimensional setting, where the dimensionality can grow exponentially with the sample size, our results reveal that the RA lasso estimator produces a consistent estimator at the same rate as the optimal rate under the light tail situation. We further study the computational convergence of the RA lasso and show that the composite gradient descent algorithm indeed produces a solution that admits the same optimal rate after sufficient iterations. As a by-product, we also establish the concentration inequality for estimating the population mean when there is only the second moment. We compare the RA lasso with other regularized robust estimators based on quantile regression and least absolute deviation regression.

We propose a new method for Laplace deconvolution which is based on expansions of the convolution kernel, the unknown function and the observed signal over a Laguerre functions basis (which acts as a surrogate eigenfunction basis of the Laplace convolution operator) using a regression setting. The expansion results in a small system of linear equations with the matrix of the system being triangular and Toeplitz. Because of this triangular structure, there is a common number m of terms in the function expansions to control, which is realized via a complexity penalty. The advantage of this methodology is that it leads to very fast computations, produces no boundary effects due to extension at zero and cut-off at T and provides an estimator with the risk within a logarithmic factor of m of the oracle risk. We emphasize that we consider the true observational model with possibly non-equispaced observations which are available on a finite interval of length T which appears in many different contexts, and we account for the bias associated with this model (which is not present in the case T). The study is motivated by perfusion imaging using a short injection of contrast agent, a procedure which is applied for medical assessment of microcirculation within tissues such as cancerous tumours. The presence of a tuning parameter a allows the choice of the most advantageous time units, so that both the kernel and the unknown right-hand side of the equation are well represented for the deconvolution.

However, if the random field were second-order non-stationary, this property does not hold. Using this property a test for second-order stationarity is constructed.

Modern application areas make it increasingly challenging for Bayesians to attempt to model the true data-generating mechanism. For instance, when the object of interest is low dimensional, such as a mean or median, it is cumbersome to have to achieve this via a complete model for the whole data distribution. More importantly, there are settings where the parameter of interest does not directly index a family of density functions and thus the Bayesian approach to learning about such parameters is currently regarded as problematic. Our framework uses loss functions to connect information in the data to functionals of interest. The updating of beliefs then follows from a decision theoretic approach involving cumulative loss functions.

Globally efficient non-parametric inference of average treatment effects by empirical balancing calibration weighting,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,10.1111/rssb.12129,"Chan, KCG(Chan, Kwun Chuen Gary)[1];Yam, SCP(Yam, Sheung Chi Phillip)[2];Zhang, Z(Zhang, Zheng)[2]",47,35,"The estimation of average treatment effects based on observational data is extremely important in practice and has been studied by generations of statisticians under different frameworks. Existing globally efficient estimators require non-parametric estimation of a propensity score function, an outcome regression function or both, but their performance can be poor in practical sample sizes. Without explicitly estimating either function, we consider a wide class of calibration weights constructed to attain an exact three-way balance of the moments of observed covariates among the treated, the control and the combined group. The wide class includes exponential tilting, empirical likelihood and generalized regression as important special cases, and extends survey calibration estimators to different statistical problems and with important distinctions. Global semiparametric efficiency for the estimation of average treatment effects is established for this general class of calibration estimators. The results show that efficiency can be achieved by solely balancing the covariate distributions without resorting to direct estimation of the propensity score or outcome regression function. We also propose a consistent estimator for the efficient asymptotic variance, which does not involve additional functional estimation of either the propensity score or the outcome regression functions. The variance estimator proposed outperforms existing estimators that require a direct approximation of the efficient influence function.",Global semiparametric efficiency; Propensity score; Sieve estimator; Treatment effects,DEMYSTIFYING DOUBLE ROBUSTNESS; MISSING RESPONSE PROBLEM; MOMENT CONDITION MODELS; PROPENSITY SCORE; INCOMPLETE DATA; ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES; TRAINING-PROGRAMS; SAMPLE PROPERTIES; CAUSAL INFERENCE; AUXILIARY DATA,"['[ 1 ]Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA', '[ 2 ]Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China']","['University of Washington', 'University of Washington Seattle', 'University of Washington', 'University of Washington Seattle', 'University of Washington', 'University of Washington Seattle', 'Chinese University of Hong Kong']",[],10.1111/rssb.12129

For example, forecasters might be asked to report the mean or a quantile of their predictive distributions. When evaluating and comparing competing forecasts, it is then critical that the scoring function used for these purposes be consistent for the functional at hand, in the sense that the expected score is minimized when following the directive. We show that any scoring function that is consistent for a quantile or an expectile functional can be represented as a mixture of elementary or extremal scoring functions that form a linearly parameterized family. Scoring functions for the mean value and probability forecasts of binary events constitute important examples. The extremal scoring functions admit appealing economic interpretations of quantiles and expectiles in the context of betting and investment problems. The Choquet-type mixture representations give rise to simple checks of whether a forecast dominates another in the sense that it is preferable under any consistent scoring function. In empirical settings it suffices to compare the average scores for only a finite number of extremal elements. Plots of the average scores with respect to the extremal scoring functions, which we call Murphy diagrams, permit detailed comparisons of the relative merits of competing forecasts.",Choquet representation; Consistent scoring function; Decision theory; Economic utility; Elicitable; Expectile; Forecast ranking; Order sensitivity; Point forecast; Probability forecast; Quantile,PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; ECONOMIC VALUE; DECISION-MAKING; SKILL SCORE; RISK; INFORMATION; RULES; CLASSIFICATION; DECOMPOSITION; DISTRIBUTIONS,"['[ 1 ]Heidelberg Inst Theoret Studies, D-69118 Heidelberg, Germany', '[ 2 ]Karlsruhe Inst Technol, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany']","['Helmholtz Association', 'Karlsruhe Institute of Technology']",[],10.1111/rssb.12154

This is caused by the temporal drift of the protein structure, e.g. due to temporal thermal inhomogeneity of the object of interest or its supporting area during the observation process. We develop a simple semiparametric model for drift correction in single-marker switching microscopy. Then we propose an M-estimator for the drift and show its asymptotic normality. This is used to correct the final image and it is shown that this purely statistical method is competitive with state of the art calibration techniques which require the incorporation of fiducial markers in the specimen. Moreover, a simple bootstrap algorithm allows us to quantify the precision of the drift estimate and its effect on the final image estimation. We argue that purely statistical drift correction is even more robust than fiducial tracking, rendering the latter superfluous in many applications. The practicability of our method is demonstrated by a simulation study and by a single-marker switching application. This serves as a prototype for many other typical imaging techniques where sparse observations with high temporal resolution are blurred by motion of the object to be reconstructed.",Asymptotic normality; Drift estimation; Image registration; M-estimation; Nanoscale fluorescence microscopy; Registration; Semiparametrics; Sparsity; Superresolution microscopy,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION; INTENSITY ESTIMATION; VARIANCE-ESTIMATION; PHASE CORRELATION; LOCALIZATION; RESOLUTION; BOOTSTRAP; FRAMEWORK; EMISSION; TRANSLATION,"['[ 1 ]Univ Gottingen, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany', '[ 2 ]Laser Lab, Gottingen, Germany', '[ 3 ]Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany']","['University of Gottingen', 'University of Gottingen', 'University of Gottingen', 'Max Planck Society']","['TowardsacoherentstatisticalframeworkfordensedeformabletemplateestimationBy:Allassonniere,S.;Amit,Y.;Trouve,A.JOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-STATISTICALMETHODOLOGY Volume: 69Pages: 3-29Part: 1Published: 2007', 'PoissoninverseproblemsBy:Antoniadis,Anestis;Bigot,JeremieANNALSOFSTATISTICS Volume: 34Issue: 5Pages: 2132-2158Published: OCT2006', 'ModernstatisticalchallengesinhighresolutionfluorescencemicroscopyBy:Aspelmeier,T.;Egner,A.;Munk,A.A.Rev.Statist.Appl.

In this ultrahigh dimensional setting, the sure independence screening procedure was introduced to reduce the dimensionality significantly by preserving the true model with overwhelming probability, before a refined second-stage analysis. However, the aforementioned sure screening property strongly relies on the assumption that the important variables in the model have large marginal correlations with the response, which rarely holds in reality. To overcome this, we propose a novel and simple screening technique called high dimensional ordinary least squares projection which we refer to as 'HOLP'. We show that HOLP has the sure screening property and gives consistent variable selection without the strong correlation assumption, and it has a low computational complexity. A ridge-type HOLP procedure is also discussed. Simulation study shows that HOLP performs competitively compared with many other marginal correlation-based methods.

Strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the equation-by-equation estimator are established in a very general framework, including dynamic conditional correlation models. The equation-by-equation estimator can be used to test the restrictions imposed by a particular multivariate generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroscedasticity specification.

However, in some problems the support of b or X, I-1 say, is a proper and unknown subset of I, and is a quantity of particular practical interest. Motivated by a real data example involving particulate emissions, we develop methods for estimating I-1. We give particular emphasis to the case I-1 = [0, theta], where theta is an element of(0, alpha], and suggest two methods for estimating a, b and theta jointly; we introduce techniques for selecting tuning parameters; and we explore properties of our methodology by using both simulation and the real data example mentioned above. Additionally, we derive theoretical properties of the methodology and discuss implications of the theory.

We propose a model-free approach for testing for the presence of such unexplained variation. To use this randomization-based approach, we must address the fact that the average treatment effect, which is generally the object of interest in randomized experiments, actually acts as a nuisance parameter in this setting. We explore potential solutions and advocate for a method that guarantees valid tests in finite samples despite this nuisance. We also show how this method readily extends to testing for heterogeneity beyond a given model, which can be useful for assessing the sufficiency of a given scientific theory. We finally apply our method to the National Head Start impact study, which is a large-scale randomized evaluation of a Federal preschool programme, finding that there is indeed significant unexplained treatment effect variation.",Causal inference; Head Start; Heterogeneous treatment effect; Randomization test,SENSITIVITY; CONFIDENCE; IMPACTS; DESIGN; TESTS,"['[ 1 ]Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA']","['Harvard University', 'Harvard University', 'Harvard University']","['DynamicConditionalCorrelation:OnPropertiesandEstimationBy:Aielli,GianPieroJOURNALOFBUSINESS&ECONOMICSTATISTICS Volume: 31Issue: 3Pages: 282-299Published: JUL2013', 'Title:[notavailable]By:AUDRINOFJRISK Volume: 6Pages: 81Published: 2004', 'ONMOMENTCONDITIONSFORQUASI-MAXIMUMLIKELIHOODESTIMATIONOFMULTIVARIATEARCHMODELSBy:Avarucci,Marco;Beutner,Eric;Zaffaroni,PaoloECONOMETRICTHEORY Volume: 29Issue: 3Pages: 545-566Published: JUN2013', 'Title:[notavailable]By:Bauwens,L;Hafner,CM;Laurent,S.HandbookofVolatilityModelsandTheirApplications Published: 2012Publisher:Wiley,NewYork', 'MultivariateGARCHmodels:AsurveyBy:Bauwens,L;Laurent,S;Rombouts,JVKJOURNALOFAPPLIEDECONOMETRICS Volume: 21Issue: 1Pages: 79-109Published: JAN-FEB2006', 'TheefficiencyoftheestimatorsoftheparametersinGARCHprocessesBy:Berkes,I;Horvath,LANNALSOFSTATISTICS Volume: 32Issue: 2Pages: 633-655Published: APR2004', 'GARCHprocesses:structureandestimationBy:Berkes,I;Horvath,L;Kokoszka,PBERNOULLI Volume: 9Issue: 2Pages: 201-227Published: APR2003', 'TheLindeberg-LevytheoremformartingalesBy:Billingsley,P.Proc.Amer.Math.Soc.

We assume that the data are collected from n subjects, each of which consists of T possibly dependent observations. The graphical models of subjects vary, but are assumed to change smoothly corresponding to a measure of closeness between subjects. We propose a kernel-based method for jointly estimating all graphical models. Theoretically, under a double asymptotic framework, where both (T,n) and the dimension d can increase, we provide an explicit rate of convergence in parameter estimation. It characterizes the strength that one can borrow across different individuals and the effect of data dependence on parameter estimation.

Empirical likelihood confidence intervals for complex sampling designs,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,10.1111/rssb.12115,"Berger, YG(Berger, Y. G.)[1];Torres, OD(Torres, O. De La Riva)[2]",68,14,"We define an empirical likelihood approach which gives consistent design-based confidence intervals which can be calculated without the need of variance estimates, designeffects, resampling, joint inclusion probabilities and linearization, even when the point estimator is not linear. It can be used to construct confidence intervals for a large class of sampling designs and estimators which are solutions of estimating equations. It can be used for means, regressions coefficients, quantiles, totals or counts even when the population size is unknown. It can be used with large sampling fractions and naturally includes calibration constraints. It can be viewed as an extension of the empirical likelihood approach to complex survey data. This approach is computationally simpler than the pseudoempirical likelihood and the bootstrap approaches. The simulation study shows that the confidence interval proposed may give better coverages than the confidence intervals based on linearization, bootstrap and pseudoempirical likelihood. Our simulation study shows that, under complex sampling designs, standard confidence intervals based on normality may have poor coverages, because point estimators may not follow a normal sampling distribution and their variance estimators may be biased.",Calibration; Design-based approach; Estimating equations; Finite population corrections; Hajek estimator; Horvitz-Thompson estimator; Regression estimator; Stratification; Unequal inclusion probabilities,FINITE POPULATIONS; UNEQUAL PROBABILITIES; VARIANCE-ESTIMATION; ESTIMATORS; CALIBRATION; INFERENCE; RATIO; LINEARIZATION; INFORMATION,"['[ 1 ]Univ Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England', '[ 2 ]Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Mexico City, DF, Mexico']","['University of Southampton', 'University of Southampton', 'University of Southampton', 'Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica']",[],10.1111/rssb.12115
Simulation of multivariate diffusion bridges,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,10.1111/rssb.12118,"Bladt, M(Bladt, Mogens)[1];Finch, S(Finch, Samuel)[2];Sorensen, M(Sorensen, Michael)[2]",32,16,"We propose simple methods for multivariate diffusion bridge simulation, which plays a fundamental role in simulation-based likelihood and Bayesian inference for stochastic differential equations. By a novel application of classical coupling methods, the new approach generalizes a previously proposed simulation method for one-dimensional bridges to the multivariate setting. First a method of simulating approximate, but often very accurate, diffusion bridges is proposed. These approximate bridges are used as proposals for easily implementable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that, apart from a small discretization error, produce exact diffusion bridges. The new method is more generally applicable than previous methods. Another advantage is that the new method works well for diffusion bridges in long intervals because the computational complexity of the method is linear in the length of the interval. In a simulation study the new method performs well, and its usefulness is illustrated by an application to Bayesian estimation for the multivariate hyperbolic diffusion model.",Bayesian inference; Coupling; Discretely sampled diffusions; Likelihood inference; Stochastic differential equation; Time reversal,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; TIME-REVERSAL,"['[ 1 ]Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico', '[ 2 ]Univ Copenhagen, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark']","['University of Copenhagen', 'University of Copenhagen', 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico', 'University of Copenhagen']","['BootstraptestsfordistributionaltreatmenteffectsininstrumentalvariablemodelsBy:Abadie,AJOURNALOFTHEAMERICANSTATISTICALASSOCIATION Volume: 97Issue: 457Pages: 284-292Published: MAR2002', 'Goodness-of-fittestswhenparametersareestimatedBy:Babu,G.J.;Rao,C.R.Sankhya Volume: 66Pages: 63-74Published: 2004', 'P-VALUESMAXIMIZEDOVERACONFIDENCESETFORTHENUISANCEPARAMETERBy:BERGER,RL;BOOS,DDJOURNALOFTHEAMERICANSTATISTICALASSOCIATION Volume: 89Issue: 427Pages: 1012-1016Published: SEP1994', 'ExperimentalevidenceondistributionaleffectsofHeadStartBy:Bitler,M.P.;Domina,T.;Hoynes,H.W.WorkingPaper Published: 2013AvailablefromPublisher:UniversityofCaliforniainIrvine,IrvineURL:http://fhya0ce5c99425c645cd8ed6ac8c60dee6b2h5pwf60u6of6060p9.fbzz.libproxy.ruc.edu.cn/~mbitler/papers/bdh-hsis-paper.pdf', ""Canvariationinsubgroups'averagetreatmenteffectsexplaintreatmenteffectheterogeneity?:evidencefromasocialexperimentBy:Bitler,M.P.;Gelbach,J.B.;Hoynes,H.W.WorkingPaper Published: 2010AvailablefromPublisher:UniversityofCaliforniainIrvine,IrvineURL:http://fhyaa8f45457808048509902cb87bd1be898h5pwf60u6of6060p9.fbzz.libproxy.ruc.edu.cn/~mbitler/papers/bgh-subgroups-paper.pdf"", 'Whatmeanimpactsmiss:DistributionaleffectsofwelfarereformexperimentsBy:Bitler,MarianneP.;Gelbach,JonahB.;Hoynes,HilaryW.AMERICANECONOMICREVIEW Volume: 96Issue: 4Pages: 988-1012Published: SEP2006', ""QuantifyingvariationinHeadStarteffectsonyoungchildren'scognitiveandsocio-emotionalskillsusingdatafromtheNationalHeadStartImpactStudyBy:Bloom,H.S.;Weiland,C.Workingpaper Published: 2015Publisher:MDRC,NewYork,NY"", 'SubsamplinginferenceonquantileregressionprocessesBy:Chernozhukov,V.;Fernandez-Val,I.Sankhya Volume: 67Pages: 253-276Published: 2005', 'INTERACTIONBy:COX,DR;ATKINSON,AC;BOX,GEP;etal.INTERNATIONALSTATISTICALREVIEW Volume: 52Issue: 1Pages: 1-31Published: 1984', 'NonparametrictestsfortreatmenteffectheterogeneityBy:Crump,RichardK.;Hotz,V.Joseph;Imbens,GuidoW.;etal.REVIEWOFECONOMICSANDSTATISTICS Volume: 90Issue: 3Pages: 389-405Published: AUG2008', 'INTERPRETATIONOFINTERACTION:AREVIEWBy:DeGonzalez,AmyBerrington;Cox,D.R.ANNALSOFAPPLIEDSTATISTICS Volume: 1Issue: 2Pages: 371-385Published: DEC2007', 'Title:[notavailable]By:Ding,P.;Feller,A.;Miratrix,L.W.TechnicalReport Published: 2015Publisher:DepartmentofStatistics,HarvardUniversity,Cambridge', 'RandomizationinferencefortreatmenteffectvariationBy:Ding,P.;Feller,A.;Miratrix,L.Workingpaper Published: 2014URL:http://fhya40d2f3db872b4fbda87100c0cb13eca3h5pwf60u6of6060p9.fbzz.libproxy.ruc.edu.cn/fles/feller/fles/ding_feller_miratrix_submission.pdf', 'HeterogeneousimpactsinPROGRESABy:Djebbari,Habiba;Smith,JeffreyJOURNALOFECONOMETRICS Volume: 145Issue: 1-2Pages: 64-80Published: JUL2008', 'PLOTTINGWITHCONFIDENCE-GRAPHICALCOMPARISONSOF2POPULATIONSBy:DOKSUM,KA;SIEVERS,GLBIOMETRIKA Volume: 63Issue: 3Pages: 421-434Published: 1976', 'Title:[notavailable]By:Durbin,J.DistributionTheoryforTestsBasedontheSampleDistributionFunction.

Detecting relevant changes in time series models,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,10.1111/rssb.12121,"Dette, H(Dette, Holger)[1];Wied, D(Wied, Dominik)[2]",39,12,"Most of the literature on change point analysis by means of hypothesis testing considers hypotheses of the formH0 :theta(1=)theta(2) versus H-1 :theta(1)not equal theta(2) where theta(1) and theta(2) denote parameters of the process before and after a change point. The paper takes a different perspective and investigates the null hypotheses of no relevant changes, i. e. H-0 : parallel to theta(1) - theta(2)parallel to <=Delta, where parallel to parallel to is an appropriate norm. This formulation of the testing problem is motivated by the fact that in many applications a modification of the statistical analysis might not be necessary, if the difference between the parameters before and after the change point is small. A general approach to problems of this type is developed which is based on the cumulative sum principle. For the asymptotic analysis weak convergence of the sequential empirical process must be established under the alternative of non- stationarity, and it is shown that the resulting test statistic is asymptotically normally distributed. The results can also be used to establish similarity of the parameters, i. e. H-1 : parallel to theta(1) - theta(2)parallel to <= Delta at a controlled type 1 error and to estimate the magnitude parallel to theta(1) - theta(2) parallel to of the change with a corresponding confidence interval. Several applications of the methodology are given including tests for relevant changes in the mean, variance, parameter in a linear regression model and distribution function among others. The finite sample properties of the new tests are investigated by means of a simulation study and illustrated by analysing a data example from portfolio management.",Change point analysis; Cumulative sum; Precise hypotheses; Relevant changes; Strong mixing; Weak convergence under the alternative,SIMPLE LINEAR-REGRESSION; CHANGE-POINT DETECTION; LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST; COVARIANCE STRUCTURE; STRUCTURAL-CHANGE; TESTS,"['[ 1 ]Ruhr Univ Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany', '[ 2 ]Tech Univ Dortmund, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany']","['Ruhr University Bochum', 'Ruhr University Bochum', 'Ruhr University Bochum', 'Dortmund University of Technology']",[],10.1111/rssb.12121
On the coverage bound problem of empirical likelihood methods for time series,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,10.1111/rssb.12119,"Zhang, XY(Zhang, Xianyang)[1];Shao, XF(Shao, Xiaofeng)[2]",38,2,"The upper bounds on the coverage probabilities of the confidence regions based on blockwise empirical likelihood and non-standard expansive empirical likelihood methods for time series data are investigated via studying the probability of violating the convex hull constraint. The large sample bounds are derived on the basis of the pivotal limit of the blockwise empirical log-likelihood ratio obtained under fixed b asymptotics, which has recently been shown to provide a more accurate approximation to the finite sample distribution than the conventional 2-approximation. Our theoretical and numerical findings suggest that both the finite sample and the large sample upper bounds for coverage probabilities are strictly less than 1 and the blockwise empirical likelihood confidence region can exhibit serious undercoverage when the dimension of moment conditions is moderate or large, the time series dependence is positively strong or the block size is large relative to the sample size. A similar finite sample coverage problem occurs for non-standard expansive empirical likelihood. To alleviate the coverage bound problem, we propose to penalize both empirical likelihood methods by relaxing the convex hull constraint. Numerical simulations and data illustrations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed remedies in terms of delivering confidence sets with more accurate coverage.

Our approach is based on data perturbation, e.g. by tilting or data sharpening. It leads to new estimators that are more accurate than conventional kernel techniques that use positive kernels, but which nevertheless enjoy the positivity property, and are far less wiggly' than high order kernel estimators.

Unlike the existing methods, no user-chosen parameter is needed to implement the RW method. As an application, these four tests are used to check the model adequacy in power generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroscedasticity models. Simulation evidence indicates that the weighted portmanteau tests have a power advantage over other existing tests.

Semiparametric estimation in the secondary analysis of case-control studies,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,10.1111/rssb.12107,"Ma, YY(Ma, Yanyuan)[1,2];Carroll, RJ(Carroll, Raymond J.)[2]",23,11,"We study the regression relationship between covariates in case-control data: an area known as the secondary analysis of case-control studies. The context is such that only the form of the regression mean is specified, so that we allow an arbitrary regression error distribution, which can depend on the covariates and thus can be heteroscedastic. Under mild regularity conditions we establish the theoretical identifiability of such models. Previous work in this context has either specified a fully parametric distribution for the regression errors, specified a homoscedastic distribution for the regression errors, has specified the rate of disease in the population (we refer to this as the true population) or has made a rare disease approximation. We construct a class of semiparametric estimation procedures that rely on none of these. The estimators differ from the usual semiparametric estimators in that they draw conclusions about the true population, while technically operating in a hypothetical superpopulation. We also construct estimators with a unique feature, in that they are robust against the misspecification of the regression error distribution in terms of variance structure, whereas all other non-parametric effects are estimated despite the biased samples. We establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators and illustrate their finite sample performance through simulation studies, as well as through an empirical example on the relationship between red meat consumption and hetero-cyclic amines. Our analysis verified the positive relationship between red meat consumption and two forms of hetro-cyclic amines, indicating that increased red meat consumption leads to increased levels of MeIQx and PhIP, both being risk factors for colorectal cancer.

It has achieved great success, but its performance can be seriously impaired if many redundant covariates are included. Some efforts have been devoted to studying variable selection for SVMs, but asymptotic properties, such as variable selection consistency, are largely unknown when the number of predictors diverges to 1. We establish a unified theory for a general class of non-convex penalized SVMs. We first prove that, in ultrahigh dimensions, there is one local minimizer to the objective function of non-convex penalized SVMs having the desired oracle property. We further address the problem of non-unique local minimizers by showing that the local linear approximation algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the oracle estimator even in the ultrahigh dimensional setting if an appropriate initial estimator is available. This condition on the initial estimator is verified to be automatically valid as long as the dimensions are moderately high.

When the tails of the distribution are proportional much of extreme value statistics remains valid. The proportionality function for the tails can be estimated non-parametrically along with the (common) extreme value index. For a positive extreme value index, joint asymptotic normality of both estimators is shown; they are asymptotically independent. We also establish asymptotic normality of a forecasted high quantile and develop tests for the proportionality function and for the validity of the model. We show through simulations the good performance of the procedures and also present an application to stock market returns.

A tilting approach to ranking influence,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,10.1111/rssb.12102,"Genton, MG(Genton, Marc G.)[1];Hall, P(Hall, Peter)[2,3]",25,4,"We suggest a new approach, which is applicable for general statistics computed from random samples of univariate or vector-valued or functional data, to assessing the influence that individual data have on the value of a statistic, and to ranking the data in terms of that influence. Our method is based on, first, perturbing the value of the statistic by 'tilting', or reweighting, each data value, where the total amount of tilt is constrained to be the least possible, subject to achieving a given small perturbation of the statistic, and, then, taking the ranking of the influence of data values to be that which corresponds to ranking the changes in data weights. It is shown, both theoretically and numerically, that this ranking does not depend on the size of the perturbation, provided that the perturbation is sufficiently small. That simple result leads directly to an elegant geometric interpretation of the ranks; they are the ranks of the lengths of projections of the weights onto a 'line' determined by the first empirical principal component function in a generalized measure of covariance. To illustrate the generality of the method we introduce and explore it in the case of functional data, where (for example) it leads to generalized boxplots. The method has the advantage of providing an interpretable ranking that depends on the statistic under consideration. For example, the ranking of data, in terms of their influence on the value of a statistic, is different for a measure of location and for a measure of scale. This is as it should be; a ranking of data in terms of their influence should depend on the manner in which the data are used. Additionally, the ranking recognizes, rather than ignores, sign, and in particular can identify left-and right-hand 'tails' of the distribution of a random function or vector.",Band depth; Data weights; Functional boxplot; Functional data; Image data; Outlier; Robustness,BAND DEPTH; BOXPLOTS,"['[ 1 ]King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia', '[ 2 ]Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia', '[ 3 ]Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA USA']","['King Abdullah University of Science & Technology', 'King Abdullah University of Science & Technology', 'King Abdullah University of Science & Technology', 'University of Melbourne', 'University of California System', 'University of California Davis']",[],10.1111/rssb.12102
Lasso regression: estimation and shrinkage via the limit of Gibbs sampling,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,10.1111/rssb.12106,"Rajaratnam, B(Rajaratnam, Bala)[1];Roberts, S(Roberts, Steven)[2];Sparks, D(Sparks, Doug)[1];Dalal, O(Dalal, Onkar)[1]",25,6,"The application of the lasso is espoused in high dimensional settings where only a small number of the regression coefficients are believed to be non-zero (i.e. the solution is sparse). Moreover, statistical properties of high dimensional lasso estimators are often proved under the assumption that the correlation between the predictors is bounded. In this vein, co-ordinatewise methods, which are the most common means of computing the lasso solution, naturally work well in the presence of low-to-moderate multicollinearity. The computational speed of co-ordinatewise algorithms, although excellent for sparse and low-to-moderate multicollinearity settings, degrades as sparsity decreases and multicollinearity increases. Though lack of sparsity and high multicollinearity can be quite common in contemporary applications, model selection is still a necessity in such settings. Motivated by the limitations of co-ordinatewise algorithms in such 'non-sparse' and 'high multicollinearity' settings, we propose the novel 'deterministic Bayesian lasso' algorithm for computing the lasso solution. This algorithm is developed by considering a limiting version of the Bayesian lasso. In contrast with co-ordinatewise algorithms, the performance of the deterministic Bayesian lasso improves as sparsity decreases and multicollinearity increases. Importantly, in non-sparse and high multicollinearity settings the algorithm proposed can offer substantial increases in computational speed over co-ordinatewise algorithms. A rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that the deterministic Bayesian lasso algorithm converges to the lasso solution and it leads to a representation of the lasso estimator which shows how it achieves both l(1)- and l(2)-types of shrinkage simultaneously. Connections between the deterministic Bayesian lasso and other algorithms are also provided. The benefits of the deterministic Bayesian lasso algorithm are then illustrated on simulated and real data.",Bayesian lasso; Lasso regression; Limit of Gibbs sampler; Multicollinearity,REWEIGHTED LEAST-SQUARES; EM ALGORITHM; MINIMIZATION; REGULARIZATION; SELECTION,"['[ 1 ]Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA', '[ 2 ]Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia']","['Stanford University', 'Stanford University', 'Stanford University', 'Australian National University']","['TestsforparameterinstabilityandstructuralchangewithunknownchangepointBy:Andrews,D.W.K.Econometrica Volume: 61Pages: 128-156Published: 1993', 'HETEROSKEDASTICITYANDAUTOCORRELATIONCONSISTENTCOVARIANCE-MATRIXESTIMATIONBy:ANDREWS,DWKECONOMETRICA Volume: 59Issue: 3Pages: 817-858Published: MAY1991', 'OptimalchangepointtestsfornormallinearregressionBy:Andrews,DWK;Lee,I;Ploberger,WJOURNALOFECONOMETRICS Volume: 70Issue: 1Pages: 9-38Published: JAN1996', 'BREAKDETECTIONINTHECOVARIANCESTRUCTUREOFMULTIVARIATETIMESERIESMODELSBy:Aue,Alexander;Hormann,Siegfried;Horvath,Lajos;etal.ANNALSOFSTATISTICS Volume: 37Issue: 6BPages: 4046-4087Published: DEC2009', 'ONDISTINGUISHINGBETWEENRANDOMWALKANDCHANGEINTHEMEANALTERNATIVESBy:Aue,Alexander;Horvath,Lajos;Huskova,Marie;etal.ECONOMETRICTHEORY Volume: 25Issue: 2Pages: 411-441Published: APR2009', 'StructuralbreaksintimeseriesBy:Aue,Alexander;Horvath,LajosJOURNALOFTIMESERIESANALYSIS Volume: 34Issue: 1Pages: 1-16Published: JAN2013', 'EstimatingandtestinglinearmodelswithmultiplestructuralchangesBy:Bai,JS;Perron,PECONOMETRICA Volume: 66Issue: 1Pages: 47-78Published: JAN1998', 'TestingprecisehypothesesBy:Berger,J.O.;Delampady,M.StatisticalScience Volume: 2Pages: 317-352Published: 1987', 'TestingforchangesinthecovariancestructureoflinearprocessesBy:Berkes,Istvan;Gombay,Edit;Horvath,LajosJOURNALOFSTATISTICALPLANNINGANDINFERENCE Volume: 139Issue: 6Pages: 2044-2063Published: JUN12009', 'Somedifficultiesofinterpretationencounteredintheapplicationofthechi-squaretestBy:Berkson,JJOURNALOFTHEAMERICANSTATISTICALASSOCIATION Volume: 33Issue: 203Pages: 526-536Published: SEP1938', 'TECHNIQUESFORTESTINGCONSTANCYOFREGRESSIONRELATIONSHIPSOVERTIMEBy:BROWN,RL;DURBIN,J;EVANS,JMJOURNALOFTHEROYALSTATISTICALSOCIETYSERIESB-METHODOLOGICAL Volume: 37Issue: 2Pages: 149-163Published: 1975', 'NONPARAMETRICCHANGE-POINTESTIMATIONBy:CARLSTEIN,EANNALSOFSTATISTICS Volume: 16Issue: 1Pages: 188-197Published: MAR1988', 'AcomparisonofestimatorsforregressionmodelswithchangepointsBy:Chen,C.;Chan,J.;Gerlach,R.;etal;Hsieh,W.Statist.Comput.

The problem of finding communities or clusters in a network has received much attention from statistics, physics and computer science. However, most clustering algorithms assume knowledge of the number of clusters k. We propose to determine k automatically in a graph generated from a stochastic block model by using a hypothesis test of independent interest. Our main contribution is twofold; first, we theoretically establish the limiting distribution of the principal eigenvalue of the suitably centred and scaled adjacency matrix and use that distribution for our test of the hypothesis that a random graph is of Erdos-Renyi (noise) type. Secondly, we use this test to design a recursive bipartitioning algorithm, which naturally uncovers nested community structure. Using simulations and quantifiable classification tasks on real world networks with ground truth, we show that our algorithm outperforms state of the art methods.",Asymptotic analysis; Community detection; Hypothesis testing; Networks; Stochastic block model; Tracy-Widom distribution,STOCHASTIC BLOCKMODELS; UNIVERSALITY; EIGENVALUES; MODELS; EDGE,"['[ 1 ]Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA', '[ 2 ]Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA']","['University of Texas System', 'University of Texas Austin', 'University of Texas System', 'University of Texas Austin', 'University of California System', 'University of California Berkeley', 'University of Texas System', 'University of Texas Austin']",[],10.1111/rssb.12117

Using post-outcome measurement information in censoring-by-death problems,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,10.1111/rssb.12113,"Yang, F(Yang, Fan)[1];Small, DS(Small, Dylan S.)[2]",38,14,"Many clinical studies on non-mortality outcomes such as quality of life suffer from the problem that the non-mortality outcome can be censored by death, i.e. the non-mortality outcome cannot be measured if the subject dies before the time of measurement. To address the problem that this censoring by death is informative, it is of interest to consider the average effect of the treatment on the non-mortality outcome among subjects whose measurement would not be censored under either treatment or control, which is called the survivor average causal effect (SACE). The SACE is not point identified under usual assumptions but bounds can be constructed. The previous literature on bounding the SACE uses only the survival information before the measurement of the non-mortality outcome. However, survival information after the measurement of the non-mortality outcome could also be informative. For randomized trials, we propose a set of ranked average score assumptions that make use of survival information before and after the measurement of the non-mortality outcome which are plausibly satisfied in many studies and we develop a two-step linear programming approach to obtain the closed form for bounds on the SACE under our assumptions. We also extend our method to randomized trials with non-compliance or observational studies with a valid instrumental variable to obtain bounds on the complier SACE which is presented in on-line supplementary material. We apply our method to a randomized trial of the effect of mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volume versus traditional tidal volume for acute lung injury patients. Our bounds on the SACE are much shorter than the bounds that are obtained by using only the survival information before the measurement of the non-mortality outcome.",Causal inference; Censoring by death; Instrumental variable; Quality of life,MONOTONE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; IDENTIFIED ECONOMETRIC-MODELS; HIV VACCINE TRIALS; PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION; VIRAL LOAD; CAUSAL INFERENCE; BOUNDS; PARAMETERS; BOOTSTRAP,"['[ 1 ]Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA', '[ 2 ]Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA']","['University of Pennsylvania', 'University of Pennsylvania', 'University of Chicago', 'University of Pennsylvania']",[],10.1111/rssb.12113
Data envelope fitting with constrained polynomial splines,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,10.1111/rssb.12098,"Daouia, A(Daouia, Abdelaati)[1,2];Noh, H(Noh, Hohsuk)[3,2];Park, BU(Park, Byeong U.)[4]",54,11,"Estimation of support frontiers and boundaries often involves monotone and/or concave edge data smoothing. This estimation problem arises in various unrelated contexts, such as optimal cost and production assessments in econometrics and master curve prediction in the reliability programmes of nuclear reactors. Very few constrained estimators of the support boundary of a bivariate distribution have been introduced in the literature. They are based on simple envelopment techniques which often suffer from lack of precision and smoothness. Combining the edge estimation idea of Hall, Park and Stern with the quadratic spline smoothing method of He and Shi, we develop a novel constrained fit of the boundary curve which benefits from the smoothness of spline approximation and the computational efficiency of linear programmes. Using cubic splines is also feasible and more attractive under multiple shape constraints; computing the optimal spline smoother is then formulated as a second-order cone programming problem. Both constrained quadratic and cubic spline frontiers have a similar level of computational complexity to those of the unconstrained fits and inherit their asymptotic properties. The utility of this method is illustrated through applications to some real data sets and simulation evidence is also presented to show its superiority over the best-known methods.",Boundary curve; Concavity; Least majorant; Linear programming; Monotone smoothing; Multiple shape constraints; Polynomial spline; Second-order cone programming,NONPARAMETRIC KERNEL REGRESSION; HULL ESTIMATORS; MONOTONE; CONVERGENCE; FRONTIERS,"['[ 1 ]Univ Toulouse, Toulouse, France', '[ 2 ]Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium', '[ 3 ]Sookmyung Womens Univ, Seoul 140742, South Korea', '[ 4 ]Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea']","[""Sookmyung Women's University"", ""Sookmyung Women's University"", 'Universite de Toulouse', 'Universite Catholique Louvain', ""Sookmyung Women's University"", 'Seoul National University (SNU)']","['Title:[notavailable]By:BELTRAOKIJTIMESERANAL Volume: 8Pages: 21Published: 1987', 'CONSISTENTAUTOREGRESSIVESPECTRALESTIMATESBy:BERK,KNANNALSOFSTATISTICS Volume: 2Issue: 3Pages: 489-502Published: 1974', 'ARCHMODELINGINFINANCE-AREVIEWOFTHETHEORYANDEMPIRICAL-EVIDENCEBy:BOLLERSLEV,T;CHOU,RY;KRONER,KFJOURNALOFECONOMETRICS Volume: 52Issue: 1-2Pages: 5-59Published: APR-MAY1992', 'GENERALIZEDAUTOREGRESSIVECONDITIONALHETEROSKEDASTICITYBy:BOLLERSLEV,TJOURNALOFECONOMETRICS Volume: 31Issue: 3Pages: 307-327Published: APR1986', 'Distributionofresidualautocorrelationsinautoregressive-integratedmovingaveragetimeseriesmodelsBy:Box,G.;Pierce,E.P.;David,A.JournaloftheAmericanStatisticalAssociation Volume: 65Issue: 332Pages: 1509-1526Published: 1970', 'PortmanteauGoodness-of-FitTestforAsymmetricPowerGARCHModelsBy:Carbon,Michel;Francq,ChristianAUSTRIANJOURNALOFSTATISTICS Volume: 40Issue: 1-2Pages: 55-64Published: 2011', 'MixingandmomentpropertiesofvariousGARCHandstochasticvolatilitymodelsBy:Carrasco,M;Chen,XHECONOMETRICTHEORY Volume: 18Issue: 1Pages: 17-39Published: FEB2002', 'AnalysisofleastabsolutedeviationBy:Chen,Kani;Ying,Zhiliang;Zhang,Hong;etal.BIOMETRIKA Volume: 95Issue: 1Pages: 107-122Published: MAR2008', 'LeastAbsoluteRelativeErrorEstimationBy:Chen,Kani;Guo,Shaojun;Lin,Yuanyuan;etal.JOURNALOFTHEAMERICANSTATISTICALASSOCIATION Volume: 105Issue: 491Pages: 1104-1112Published: SEP2010', 'Sign-basedportmanteautestforARCH-typemodelswithheavy-tailedinnovationsBy:Chen,M.;Zhu,K.J.Econmetr.

This provides information about the strength and shape of modes and can also be used as a significance test. We use a data splitting approach in which potential modes are identified by using the first half of the data and inference is done with the second half of the data. To obtain valid confidence sets for the eigenvalues, we use a bootstrap based on an elementary symmetric polynomial transformation. This leads to valid bootstrap confidence sets regardless of any multiplicities in the eigenvalues. We also suggest a new method for bandwidth selection, namely choosing the bandwidth to maximize the number of significant modes. We show by example that this method works well. Even when the true distribution is singular, and hence does not have a density (in which case cross-validation chooses a zero bandwidth), our method chooses a reasonable bandwidth.",Bootstrap; Density estimation; Modes; Persistence,KERNEL; MULTIMODALITY; ESTIMATORS; TESTS; ASYMPTOTICS; CONSISTENCY; UNIFORM; SPACE,"['[ 1 ]Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA', '[ 2 ]Univ Rome, Rome, Italy']","['Carnegie Mellon University', 'Carnegie Mellon University', 'Carnegie Mellon University', 'Sapienza University Rome']",[],10.1111/rssb.12111
The lasso for high dimensional regression with a possible change point,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,10.1111/rssb.12108,"Lee, S(Lee, Sokbae)[1,2];Seo, MH(Seo, Myung Hwan)[3,1];Shin, Y(Shin, Youngki)[4]",45,18,"We consider a high dimensional regression model with a possible change point due to a covariate threshold and develop the lasso estimator of regression coefficients as well as the threshold parameter. Our lasso estimator not only selects covariates but also selects a model between linear and threshold regression models. Under a sparsity assumption, we derive non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for both the prediction risk and the l(1)-estimation loss for regression coefficients. Since the lasso estimator selects variables simultaneously, we show that oracle inequalities can be established without pretesting the existence of the threshold effect. Furthermore, we establish conditions under which the estimation error of the unknown threshold parameter can be bounded by a factor that is nearly n(-1) even when the number of regressors can be much larger than the sample size n. We illustrate the usefulness of our proposed estimation method via Monte Carlo simulations and an application to real data.",Lasso; Oracle inequalities; Sample splitting; Sparsity; Threshold
