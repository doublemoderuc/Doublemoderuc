1,"Innervation of the Brachioradialis Muscle in Brazilian Individuals: Anatomo-clinical aspects of the Biometry of Origin and Nervous Distribution",International Journal of Morphology,2020年4月,0,17,"SUMMARY: The nerve for the brachioradialis muscle (BR) has been used in nerve transfers for recoveries in functions of the hand as a consequence of lesions affecting the brachial plexus. With the purpose of investigating the number and biometric location of the primary branches coming from the radial nerve and motor points with respect to a reference point located in the elbow region, thirty upper limbs of Brazilian adult individuals from the State University of Sciences of Saúde de Alagoas, Maceió, Brazil were used. The samples were fixed in 10 % formaldehyde solution, of which 15 were right and 15 left. As a reference point, a line was used that passed through the most prominent parts of the humeral epicondyls, bi-epicondilar line (BEL). With respect to the nervous origin for the BR muscle, all the branches originated from the radial nerve (RN). The average number of primary branches (PB) was 1.53 (SD 0.73). In 18 samples (60 %) only one PB was observed; in 8 cases (26.7 %) 2 PB were found, while in 4 cases (13.3 %) of the sample 3 PB were observed. Regarding the biometric location of the origins of PB, it is important to mention that all were located proximal to the BEL. On average, these were located at 38 mm (SD 0.9); 29 mm (DS 1.2) and 22 mm (DS 1.0) for the first, second and third PB, respectively. In relation to the motor points (MP), in 4 cases (13 %) 1 MP was observed as direct penetration of the PB, in 13 cases (43 %) there were 2 MP, in 8 cases (27 %) they found 3 MP and in 5 cases (17 %) 4 MP were observed. In three cases (10 %) the innervation towards the BR muscle emitted nerve fillets towards the extensor carpi radialis longus muscle. The results presented in this investigation are an important contribution to nerve blocks, electrical stimulations and nerve transfers.",Anatomy; Innervation; Motor points; Brachioradialis muscle; Biometry,,"[ 1 ] Universidad Central de Chile, Chile

Biometric Localization of the Motor Points of the Femoral Quadriceps Muscle of Brazilian Individuals",International Journal of Morphology,2020年12月,0,18,"The quadriceps femoris muscle is a muscle that participates mainly in the movements of the knee and also in the hip, being able to be affected by alterations in muscle trophism, after injuries of these joints or muscular tone conditions, such as spasticity, after injuries cerebrovascular. Each of its heads is innervated by branches of the femoral nerve. The objective of this study was to identify and measure the distance of the motor points (MP) of the quadriceps femoris muscle, in relation to anatomical structures of clinical relevance. Thirty lower limbs of 23 formolized corpses of adult Brazilian individuals were used. The study was conducted at the State University of Ciencias da Saude de Alagoas (UNCISAL), Maceio, Brazil. The dissection was performed by planes in the medial, anterior and lateral thigh, identifying the femoral nerve branches for each component, rectus femoris muscles (Rfm), medial vastus (mVm), vastus intermedius (intVm) and vastus lateralis (latVm), locating each of the MP. The measurements were made with a Mitutoyo caliper of 0.05 mm accuracy. The data obtained were treated statistically, using the STATA software (version 14.1). The Rfm had an average of 2.45 +/- 1.39 MP, the great majority of the MP (63 %) being in the distal area of the proximal third of the thigh; the mVm presented 4.42 +/- 2.74 MP on average, with 41 % of them in the middle third of the thigh, distal zone; the intVm had 3.99 + 2.34 MP on average and 58 % of them were located in the proximal area of the middle third of the thigh; the latVm presented an average of 3.88 +/- 2.37 MP and 50 % of these were found in the proximal third of the thigh.

Biometric relationships between body size and otolith size in 15 demersal marine fish species from the northern Brazilian coast",Acta Amazonica,2020年12月,0,25,The relationships between fish size and sagitta otolith measurements were calculated for the first time for 15 species belonging to six families from the northern Brazilian coast. A total of 220 fish were sampled from the bycatch landed by the bottom-trawl industrial shrimp-fishing fleet between August and September 2016. All species had strong relationships between otolith measurements and fish total length with the coefficient of determination (r(2)) ranging between 0.71 and 0.99. The variable most strongly related to fish total length was found to be the sagittal otolith length (OL) with 98% of the variability. These relationships are a useful tool to estimate length and mass of preyed fish from otoliths found in stomach contents of marine predators.,Amazon delta; bycatch; sagitta; Neotropics; Sciaenidae; stomach content,LENGTH;?SEA,"Universidade Federal do Para?Univ Fed Para, Nucleo Ecol Aquat & Pesca Amazonia, Grp Ecol Aquat, Belem, Para, Brazil.","Univ Fed Para, Nucleo Ecol Aquat & Pesca Amazonia, Grp Ecol Aquat, Belem, Para, Brazil",

Biometric characterization was done with 100 fruits and 100 seeds from two lots. For the characterization of the seed hydration, the process was carried out soaking curve of seed lots with and without lopping. In order to evaluate the best method of breaking seed dormancy, a completely randomized experimental design was used in a 2 x 9 factorial scheme (harvest years x pre-germination treatments). We also evaluated nine pre-germinating treatments to overcome seed dormancy: control; cutting with scissors and scarification with sandpaper 80, at the opposite end to the hilum; hot water at 80 °C for 3, 6 and 12 minutes and sulfuric acid (98%) for 3, 6 and 12 minutes, and evaluated the percentage and speed of germination index, shoot length and root dry weight of shoot, root and total. The seeds of M. ophthalmocentra have low variation for biometric features and the larger variations occur from plant materials. Seed germination starts after 19 hours of imbibition, regardless of plant material.

Multidimensional biometric analysis with pre-germination treatments in seeds and morphological characterization of Mimosa bimucronata (De Candolle) Otto Kuntze seedlings",Revista de Ciências Agrárias,2020年6月,0,38,"ABSTRACT:  Considering that neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) causes deleterious effects on fertility, the objective was to evaluate the effect of feeding quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica Linnaeus, 1758) of 90 days old with neem seeds on seminal quality, biometric parameters, and testicular morphometrics, as an experimental model. After the 30 day adaptation period to the experimental conditions, birds were randomly distributed in five treatments of neem seeds incorporated into feed, with 10 replicates: T1 (0%), T2 (5%), T3 (10%), T4 (20%) and T5 (40%). After 60 days of receiving experimental rations, their semen was collected to evaluate the sperm quality, the birds were euthanized, and testes were submitted to biometric, histological, and histomorphometric evaluation. The data were evaluated by analysis of variance and later by Tukey test with a significance level of 5%. The mean values of testicle weight, length, and width significantly decreased in T4 and T5, due degeneration of germinal epithelial cells. In these treatments, it occurred a significant increase (P&gt;0.05) in the average values of the tunica albuginea thickness and a significant reduction in the values of the seminiferous tubule diameter and the height of the germinal epithelium. In addition, the mean values of seminal volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, vigor, and sperm viability were significantly reduced. Thus, the use of neem in bird feeding, as well as the use for therapeutic purposes, is questionable, considering its negative impact on reproduction.",?Cat’s claw; forest seeds; dormancy; germination,,"[ 1 ] Universidade Estadual Paulista, Brasil

Reproductive toxicity of neem seeds (Azadirachta indica) in male quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica)",Ciência Rural,2020年,0,35,"Abstract Prochilodus magdalenae has historically been one of the most important food sources for the human population nationwide. This Colombian endemic species represents more than 50% of all catches in the main river basins of the country. The isolation of the population of P. magdalenae in the Atrato basin demands the adoption of conservation measures adapted to their biological and reproductive characteristics. During our study we recorded the biometric information of P. magdalenae catches obtained via artisanal fishing in the Marriaga swamp (Atrato River lower basin) from April 2014 to March 2015. From a total of 574 recorded individuals, 427 were females and 147 males. The female size ranged between 200 and 415 mm (standard length, SL), and the male size ranged between 210 and 415 mm (SL). In females, the length-weight analysis indicated an isometric growth (6=2.95) and a high correlation between the two variables (r2=0.81). In males, it indicated a negative allometric growth (6=1.87) and a low correlation (r2=0,56). The average size at maturity for the whole analyzed population was 365 mm (SL). The highest period of reproductive activity was estimated between October and March. The size ranges, the average size at maturity, and the spawning seasons of the individuals registered in the Marriaga swamp differed from those registered in the middle and lower area of the Atrato river basin, and other basins where the P. magdalenae has been studied. ? 2019.

Significant phenotypic and genotypic correlations were observed for production of marketable spikes, positive and of high magnitude with crude protein, dry mass and final plant stand. However, the direct effect between dry mass and production of marketable spikes was pronounced negative (-0.7085), whereas the phenotypic correlation was positive and showed medium magnitude (0.5343), which should be considered the indirect effect of final plant stand (0.7367), to take advantage of the gains of these two traits. The final plant stand is determinant to increase the production of dry matter and marketable spikes, both direct and indirectly.

Sixty eyeballs were assessed from 30 dogs of different breeds using an 8.5MHz microconvex transductor. First, biometry was performed by B-scan of the following segments: axial length (M1), anterior chamber depth (M2), lens thickness (M3), lens length (M4), vitreous chamber depth (M5), optical disc length (M6) and optic nerve diameter (M7). Colored Doppler identified the external ophthalmic article and pulsed Doppler assessed its flow, and the following were measured: systolic peak velocity (VPS), final diastolic velocity (VDF), resistivity index (IR) and pulse index (IP). No statistical difference was observed for the biometric values of the eye segments between the right and left eyes (p &gt; 0.05). The vitreous chamber depth (M5) was shown to be the biometric variable with greatest bilateral symmetry, varying from 0.79 to 0.87cm and 0.78 to 0.86cm for the right and left eye, respectively. The ophthalmic artery was visualized over the optic nerve towards the eyeball, with flow stained red.

The aim of this study was to determine whether T. triangulare leaf micromorphometry is affected when grown in full sun and under shade, and if so, which plant biometric variables are affected. T. triangulare cultivation was tested in beds arranged in blocks under shade levels of 0, 18, 30, and 50%. Each bed was considered a basic experimental unit, totaling four replications per treatment. Plant height, stem diameter, leaf area, leaf fresh weight, stem fresh weight, specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, abaxial epidermis, and mesophyll thickness were higher as shade levels increased. However, there was a decrease in the number of leaves, root to shoot ratio, stomatal density on abaxial and adaxial surfaces, and palisade parenchyma thickness. Nevertheless, root length, leaf and stem dry weights, leaf weight ratio, adaxial stomatal index, adaxial epidermis, and spongy parenchyma thickness remained constant.

The case-cohort design has been widely used in clinical and epidemiological studies to assess the effects of covariates on failure times. Most statistical methods developed for the case-cohort design use the proportional hazards model, and few methods allow for time-varying regression coefficients. In addition, most methods disregard data from subjects outside of the subcohort, which can result in inefficient inference. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes an estimation procedure for the semiparametric additive hazards model with case-cohort/two-phase sampling data, allowing the covariates of interest to be missing for cases as well as for non-cases. A more flexible form of the additive model is considered that allows the effects of some covariates to be time varying while specifying the effects of others to be constant. An augmented inverse probability weighted estimation procedure is proposed. The proposed method allows utilizing the auxiliary information that correlates with the phase-two covariates to improve efficiency. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. An extensive simulation study shows that the augmented inverse probability weighted estimation is more efficient than the widely adopted inverse probability weighted complete-case estimation method.

Different destructive, non-destructive or indirect methods are used for its determination. The estimation of the leaf area is an important biometric observation that must be made when comparing the behavior of plants in response to different agricultural treatments. The objective of the study was to determine and validate the most accurate regression functions for non-destructive estimation of leaf area in some cultivars of peach and plum. In this work, mathematical functions were applied to estimate leaf area in the plum cultivars Gold Fruly, Ecuatoriano, Methley and Horvin, and in the peach cultivars Dorado, Rubidoux, Diamante and Rey Negro. The leaves were collected from trees grown in Paipa, Colombia. A regression function was selected for each cultivar and the estimated leaf area data was compared with the functions and data measured with a leaf area integrated analyzer. The product for the length by the width of the leaf was used as independent variable (X) of the function. In all cases, the Pearson correlation coefficient presented values higher than 0.9, indicating the close relationship between the estimated and observed data. With the use of these functions, it is possible to non-destructively estimate the leaf area in the peach and plum cultivars involved in the study.",Fusion of segmentations; iris segmentation; consensus segmentation; trait extraction; ordinal measures; ordinal co-occurrence matrix,,"[ 1 ] Centro de Aplicaciones de Tecnologías de Avanzada (CENATAV)., Cuba",,

Nonlinear regression models have been widely used for description of growth curves. However, several studies in this subject do not consider the residual analysis, the existence of a possible dependence between longitudinal observations, or the sample variance heterogeneity, compromising the modeling quality. The objective of this work was to compare the fit of nonlinear regression models, considering residual analysis and assumption violations, in the description of the cacao (clone Sial-105) fruit growth. The data evaluated were extracted from Brito and Silva (1983), who conducted the experiment in the Cacao Research Center, Ilheus, State of Bahia. The variables fruit length, diameter and volume as a function of fruit age were studied. The use of weighting and incorporation of residual dependencies was efficient, since the modeling became more consistent, improving the model fit.

This paper proposes biometric characterization of the kidneys from cats, Felis catus, on the macroscopic aspects (length, height, width, weight and volume), mesoscopic (height of the cortex and medulla, and their inter-relationship) and microscopic (glomerular volume) in order to establish possible differences arising from age, gender and bilateral symmetry. It where used 30 kidneys of animals from specie Felis catus (cat), 15 males and 15 females with ages between 3 months to 15 years, divided into three groups: group 1 (3-9 months), group 2 (3-5 years) and group 3 (above 10 years). The kidneys were photographed, weighed, measured and processed for histology. The glomerular volume was obtained by stereology. The macroscopic data allowed to observe a morphometric and morphologic impartiality when compared sides, regardless of group and sex, about the length, height, width, weight and kidney volume. Significant difference was detected between males and females regardless of age for length, height, weight and volume, except for the width. There was a significant difference for all parameters considering the age: length, height, width, weight and volume. Wasnt detected signficant diferences between left and right kdney measurements of cortex, medulla and their inter-relationship, when considered bilateral symmetry. No difference was detected between males and females in mesoscopy in the cortex, medulla and cortex interrelationship cortex/medulla. Regarding age, the measurement of the height of the cortex and the interrelationship cortex/medulla showed a significant difference, but this difference was not established to the medulla of the kidney. Significant differences were found between groups, males and females, compared to the volume occupied by the glomerulus on the parenchyma renal. In all of biometric techniques there wasnt differences between right and left kidneys.

Revista Brasileira de Gest?o Urbana,2015年8月,1,48,"The increasingly psychological terrain of crime and disorder management has had a transformative impact upon the use of electronic monitoring technologies. Surveillance technologies such as electronic monitoring-EM, biometrics, and video surveillance have flourished in commercial environments that market the benefits of asocial technologies in managing disorderly behavior and which, despite often chimerical crime prevention promises, appeal to the ontologically insecure social imagination. The growth of EM in criminal justice has subsequently taken place despite, at best, equivocal evidence that it protects the public and reduces recidivism. Innovative developments in Portugal, Argentina and the United States have re-imagined EM technologies as more personalized devices that can support victims rather than control offenders. These developments represent a re-conceptualization of the use of the technology beyond the neoliberal prism of rational choice theories and offender-oriented thinking that influenced first generation thinking about EM. This paper identifies the socio-political influences that helped conceptualize first generation thinking about EM as, firstly, a community sentence and latterly, as a technique of urban security.

66,Legal Challenges of Biometric Immigration Control Systems,Mexican law review,2014年12月,0,34,"This article analyzes the deployment of biometric systems in immigration control. It argues that public policy for biometric data collection and processing must be based on legal principles and involve the participation of diverse actors, including civil society organizations, industry associations, special privacy advocates and government officials. Such deployments must also involve control mechanisms that help ensure transparency and accountability. Based on a comparative study of biometric immigration control system deployment in four countries (Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and Spain), two types of asymmetries stand out: first, notable differences in the types of information collected, stored, processed, retrieved, updated, analyzed and exchanged; Second, the purposes for which biometric systems are currently used. In the latter case, wide divergence exists in areas for which these systems are employed, such as border control strategies and the use of travel documents, revealing that each nation chooses to use these systems at different points in the immigration process. These asymmetries pose both short and long-term challenges for international cooperation.",Biometrics; biometric systems; border controls; ePassports,,"?University of Tasmania, Australia",,

H. B. K, of Cristo, Santarem 2 and Tocantins 1 clones, of the Embrapa Eastern Amazon Germplasm Bank, were characterized and subjected to pre-germinative treatments in order to increase the percentage and accelerating germination of seeds. In characterization, the following aspects were considered: weight, length, width, number of seeds and locules per pyrene and endocarp thickness. Treatments to overcome dormancy consisted of a) pre soaking the diaspores in a solution of gibberellic acid (500 mg L-1), b) pre soaking in water followed by fractures in the endocarp, and c) pre soaked in gibberellic acid with subsequent fracture of the endocarp. A control treatment, represented by pyrenes not submitted to treatment for overcome dormancy, was added for comparison purposes. The diaspores of the three clones, with most frequency, contain more than one seed. The presence of seedless pyrenes was only 1% in Cristo and Santarem 1 clones. On the other hand, in the Tocantins 1 clone the proportion of seedless pyrenes was 4%. The Christ clone diaspores showed higher mass and larger size than the other two clones. In terms of average number of seeds per pyrene similar values were observed in Christ (1.7) and Santarem 2 (1.8) clones, while this value was lower in Tocantins 1 (1.3) clone.

One case is that covariance matrices are known, the other one is that covariance matrices are unknown but common. For the general case that covariance matrices are known the test statistic is obtained using the likelihood ratio method. When the known covariance matrices are common and diagonal, the null distribution of test statistic is derived and its critical values are computed at different significance levels. A Monte Carlo study is also presented to estimate the power of the test. A test statistic is proposed for the case when the common covariance matrices are unknown. Since it is difficult to compute the exact p-value for this problem of testing with the classical method when the covariance matrices are completely unknown, we first present a reformulation of the test statistic based on the orthogonal projections on the closed convex cones and then determine the upper bounds for its p-values.

The local populations live by harvesting fruits, and find a source of income in the nance fruit, selling it in street markets. Despite the social importance of those fruit species which are native to certain regions, there is little information about these species. In view of the above, the objective here was to evaluate the fruits of different nance genotypes, using biometric characterization and the genetic relationships between those genotypes. Eighteen genotypes of the nance were analysed, taken from the municipalities of Pacajus, Fortaleza and Paraipaba in the state of Ceara. Thirty measurements were taken, each corresponding to a single fruit, in which the following were analysed: weight, diameter, length, color (L, a*, b*) firmness and yield, this last being based on 100g of pulp. From the results, oblong fruit were predominant, especially the EM 4 genotype which presented the greatest weight. The residual variance, genetic variance, repeatability and phenotypic correlations between variables were all estimated. The multivariate techniques used (genotype clustering using Tocher optimisation, principal-component analysis, and analysis of the dissimilarity of the genotypes expressed as a dendrogram based on nearest-neighbor methodology) had similar results, showing that the three genotypes EM 3, EM 4 and PAC 6 presented different results from each other and the rest of the group, having a genetic variability which would potentially allow for usage in breeding programs.",Byrsonima dealbata;?Nance;?Tropical fruits;?Graphic dispersion,REPEATABILITY;?CAPSICUM,"Universidade Federal do Ceara?Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Fitotecnia, Ctr Ciencia Agr, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.","Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Fitotecnia, Ctr Ciencia Agr, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil",

Estimating the leaf area is an important remark to be made biometric to compare the growth of plants. In this study, a model for calculating leaf area was developed for Combretum leprosum using linear measurements of leaf length (C) and maximum width (L), in order to obtain an equation by the linear dimensions of the leaf. It was collected 200 leaf blades of a population of C. leprosum native in a conservation area of Caatinga in the campus of the Federal Rural University of the Semi Arid in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte. The leaves were obtained from adults and leaf area was measured using an integrator leaf area (LI-3100, LI-COR). The analysis of variance of the regression was made in the program SAEG. The linear and geometric equations can be used to estimate leaf area of C. leprosum. From a practical standpoint, it is suggested to opt for the simple linear equation involving the C x L, using the regression equation A = 0.7103 x (C x L), which is equivalent to taking 71.03% of product of the length along the midrib and the maximum width, with a coefficient of determination of 0.952617.",gibberellic acid; diaspores; purple-flower; potassium nitrate; viability,,"[ 1 ] Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Brasil

To that effect, cages (Cs) and earthen ponds (EPs) were used as experimental systems to provide unsuitable and suitable conditions, respectively, for curimbata (Prochilodus lineatus) breeders. Fish were maintained under experimental conditions for 18 months, and during this period females were randomly sampled every two months for biometric analysis (n=30), blood (n=5/sampling) and ovary (n=5/sampling). After this period EPs females (EPFs) and Cs females (CFs) were submitted to the induced breeding experiments. The results showed that rearing curimbata for such long time in a cage at this stocking density, reduces its growth, plasma E2 levels and vitellogenesis. During vitellogenesis, the mean plasma estradiol levels of CFs were three times lower than those of EPFs (P&lt;0.01). CFs presented poorer results than EPFs for all the examined parameters of reproductive performance. Taken together these data showed that the reduced estradiol levels during vitellogenesis (and the consequently less intense transition from the previtellogenic to vitellogenic phase) and reduced amounts of yolk are mechanisms associated with the formation of low quality oocytes and shortened and delayed breeding season in this species. Moreover, our data showed that the onset of vitellogenesis (six months before the spawning season) must be considered as a key period related to the formation of oocytes of good quality, and adequate management should be provided throughout the year.",Morphology;?biometry;?reproductive organs;?Trachemys scripta elegans;?Brazil;?testis;?penis;?epididymis;?turtle;?reptiles,SEX-DETERMINATION;?CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION;?DUCTULI EFFERENTES;?CHELONIA-MYDAS;?TURTLE;?TESTUDINES;?SOUTHERN;?TESTIS;?MATURATION;?EPIDIDYMIS,"Universidade Federal do Vale do Sao Francisco?Univ Fed Vale Sao Francisco Univasf, Rodovia 407 Km 12,Lote 543,Projeto Nilo Coelho C1, BR-56300000 Petrolina, PE, Brazil.","Univ Fed Vale Sao Francisco Univasf, Rodovia 407 Km 12,Lote 543,Projeto Nilo Coelho C1, BR-56300000 Petrolina, PE, Brazil",

85,Innervation and Localization of the Motor Points of Triceps Surae Muscle,International Journal of Morphology,2012年9月,2,0,"The knowledge of innervation of muscles is generally described, but we can complement the point where the nerves penetrate the muscle belly, from the biometric standpoint. In order to know the innervation and motor points in the components of the triceps surae muscle, 18 formolized lower limbs of adult Chilean individuals were studied. Planes dissection was performed by identifying the point nerve of the lateral and medial head of gastrocnemius muscle and soleus muscle. All specimens were schematized and photographed. We identified the source of the branches, about a line drawn between the most prominent parts of the femoral epicondyles (BECL), as well as the points of entry into the muscle belly, classifying these branches as principal (BR) and secondary (SBR). In all samples the innervations came from the tibial nerve. The medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle received one branch (BR1) in 15 cases and two (BR1 and BR2) in 3 cases. The BR1 origin is located on average 23.6 +/- 11.5 mm distal to the BECL, in 15 cases the BR1 split up into four SBR. The points where these latter entered in muscular belly regarding BECL were on average: 40.4 + 11.1 mm (SBR1) distal to this line and 46.9 +/- 9.1 mm (SBR2). The lateral head received one branch in 17 cases and two in 1 case; the origin of BR1 was found on average to 35.6 +/- 11,8 mm distal to the BECL; in 12 cases the BR1 was divided up in four SBR. Regarding to BECL the SBR entered in muscle belly distal to this line, 49.4 +/- 9.3 mm (SBR1) and 52.4 +/- 10.6 mm (SBR2). The soleus muscle received his branch from a common trunk with the lateral head of the gastrocnemius in 7 cases and one direct branch BR1 in 6 cases and two branches (BR1 and BR2) in 5 cases, of which 3 of them received one anterior branch and posterior branch; the origin of BR1 was located 40.4 +/- 14.4 mm distal to the BECL; the common trunk origin was located at 20.2 mm distal from this line. The BR1 was divided up into seven SBR. These results are a contribution to the anatomy of the motor points, which can be used as a reference for application of electrical stimulation therapy and for electromyographic studies in our population.",,,"Gerencia de Calidad e Innovacion, Registro Nacional de Identificacion y Estado Civil, Lima, Peru.

The experiment was performed in the Department of Soil and Rural Agricultural Engineering of the Center of Agricultural Sciences (CCA), Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB), from August to October 2008. The experimental design was that of randomized blocks in split plots, where the plots were the levels of liquid biofertilizer at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% by volume of 10% of the total substratum volume (250 mL), the subplots were the five plant evaluation periods (45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 days after the sowing); the experiment was performed in quadruplicate. The application of biofertilizer was made 30 days before sowing, followed by a washing of the soil (two days after of biofertilizer application); a second application of the biofertilizer was made 48 hours before sowing, followed by a soil washing similar to that of the first application. Non-saline water was used for irrigation, adding the water equivalent to the evapotranspiration rate per 24 hours, based on weighing the pots. The increased level of organic matter input provided greater plant height and stem diameter, as well as greater leaf number, foliar area and total dry matter, surpassing the control by 134.78; 114.72; 127.35; 416.54 and 107.97%, respectively.",biometry; morphology; pau-roses; germination,,"Univ Estadual N Fluminen, Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil.","Univ Estadual N Fluminen, Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil",

The objectives were to analyze biometrics of fruits and seeds of C. adamantium and C. pubescens, and the process of emergence of seedlings, for comparisons between species. In November 2007, 50 fruits of each species were measured of the transversal length (mm) and longitudinal (mm) of the fruits and seeds, fresh weight of fruits (g), number of locules per fruit and number of loci seeds. For the emergence testing, two independent experiments, one for each species, were installed in a completely randomized design with six methods of fruit processing for removal, drying or washing the mucilage, and four replicates with 40 seeds per plot. With the fruits of greater volume, with accumulation of fresh and wider biometrics in relation to C. pubescens, C. adamantium has a potential for selection of promising materials for breeding purposes. Drying in the shade for 24 hours with seed mucilage reduces the percentage of emergence and normal seedlings of C. adamantium, besides the seedlings emergence rate, although this method is indifferent to seedlings of C. pubescens. Under the same experimental conditions, seedlings of C. pubescens have a higher emergence capacity and normal seedlings as well as higher daily frequencies of seedlings emerged and reducing the time of emergence in relation to the seedlings of C. adamantium.",,,"[ 1 ] Instituto Federal Goiano, Brasil

The local techniques and tools used by crab gatherers, as well as the aspects of trade and territoriality are discussed. The data were obtained from September 2007 to December 2009 through open-ended recorded interviews and behavioral observation, considering the usual methods for ethnographic work. A total of 57 artisanal fishermen of both genders and aged between 10 and 78 years were interviewed. The data were analyzed to compare the information provided by participants with those registered in the academic literature. There were four campaigns of biometric analysis of portunid crabs (Callinectes spp.) to determine their sex ratio and morphometry. The capture of resources has a predominantly economic motivation, but is also the main income source of these fishermen. In the biometric analysis of mangrove-crabs, the preference by larger animals was showed regardless the gender. It was also noted the territoriality phenomenon in fishing, though the ""fisheries"" are freely accessible to all. The artisanal fishing of brachyuran crustaceans of economic importance in Conde is performed with a variety of techniques and equipments that in a direct or indirect way interfere with the fauna and ecosystem dynamics.

Different points of view such as biometry, ethno botany, and biochemistry join to understand the biocultural processes covering the development of traditions associated with diet. Ancient diet can be analyzed from a dental wear point of view using a morpho-functional perspective since the relationship established between the masticatory system and the food components compromises the progressive loss of enamel and their relationship with the nutrition traditions of a population. METHODS: this article shows the research results on dental wear of 37 individuals from a pre-conquest human population of Sonso cultural tradition from Colombia.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of urea fertilization on substrate and leaves for rooted cocoa tree cutting and to define N recommendable doses and foliar critical N level. The experiment was set up in a rooted cutting breeding nursery of the Cocoa Biofactory Institute, in Ilheus, Bahia, in July 2006, involving 10 treatments (two fertilization treatments and five urea doses), in random blocks with four repetitions. Each plot consisted of 12 rooted cocoa cuttings in plastic tubes, containing 288 cm? substrate (50 % coconut fiber and 50 % Plantmax?). The substrate was limed with 3.20 kg m-3 and fertilized with 2.68 kg m-3 of single superphosphate. The treatments were applied between the 82nd and 138th day, with the following weekly N doses to the substrate (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg dm-3) and to the leaves (0.0, 2.25, 4.5, 9.0 and 13.5 g L-1). For all treatments, fertilization was supplemented with P, K, S, Zn and B via substrate. On the 145th day, the plants were harvested to evaluate diameter, height, leaf area, shoot dry matter (SDM), nutrient concentration in the diagnostic leaf and nutrient content in the shoot. The biometric and nutrient variables responded to treatments. Adding urea to the substrate led to the maximum yield, exceeding foliar fertilization for SDM, height and leaf area. The N doses recommended to obtain 99 % of the maximum yield varied, according to the biometric variable, from 43 to 76 mg dm-3 for fertilization on substrate and from 9.1 to 11.7 g L-1 for foliar fertilization.

Measurements by means of magnetic resonance imaging were performed by two specialists in imaging diagnosis for calculating the interobserver variability of the method. RESULTS: Calculation of the Pearson's correlation coefficient between measurements of the cervical length demonstrated a significant correlation between the results of both methods (r=0.628; p&lt;0.01). The paired t test demonstrated no statistically significant difference between measurements obtained by transvaginal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (p=0.068). Interobserver agreement in cervical measurements by magnetic resonance imaging was high (a=0.96), demonstrating the reliability of the method. CONCLUSION: The comparison between both imaging methods in the evaluation of cervical biometry showed no statistically significant difference thus reinforcing the utilization of ultrasonography.

Heritability for average fruit weight and external longitudinal length were higher than 80%, with a variation index higher than one. Thus, application of simple breeding methods, such as mass selection, will result in good selection gains. Concerning simple correlations, most of the characteristic pairs (80%) had genotypic correlations higher than phenotypic and environmental correlations. Simple and canonical correlations revealed that fruit average weight increased together with increments in pulp thickness and longitudinal and transversal fruit length. On the other hand, plants with more fruits produced smaller fruits (longitudinal length), with thinner pulp, but with higher transversal length.

No differences of larval specific growth rate due to the feeding frequencies were observed. No effects of feeding frequency on rates of survival, mortality, cannibalism and stress resistance were detected. The survival rates showed the highest values (93%) during the experiment. Thus, trairao larvae can be fed only twice a day, with no changes on growth, at least during the initial rearing (first 23 days).",Momordica charantia L.; vine species; descriptive statistical; inference,,"Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-?rido, Brazil",,

130,Innervation of the Semimembronosus Muscle,International Journal of Morphology,2005年,2,42,"Classical Anatomy books describe muscle innervation in a very general way. As an example biometric location of muscular branches and their respective motor points are not quite clear. Therefore, it is necessary to know their exact position when therapies such as electric stimulation or injection of neurolytic substances are applied. On this purpose to shed some light on these matters, it was studied the semimembranosus muscle innervation on 28 lower limbs specimens of 14 formalyzed cadavers from adult male of Brazilian origin. In order to obtain their biometric records, the landmark points employed here were arranged from the distal part of the ischiatic tuberosity (IT) followed by an imaginary transversal line deployed over the most prominent parts of the femoral epicondyles. On 18 cases it was observed only one innervation branch, coming from the tibial portion of the ischiatic nerve directed to the semimembranosus muscle and in the remaining 10 cases it was observed that two branches were received by the semimembranosus muscle. In 60,7% of cases the branch originated from a common trunk together at the magnus adductor muscle branch. In the group with one branch, the average distance from the R1 origin respect to IT was 121,8 mm ± 24,6 at the right side and 124,7 mm ± 15,9 at the left side. In the group with two branches the average distance at the right side for both R1 was 125,5 mm + 28,0 and for R2 123,7 mm ± 29,2. At the left side both distances were 111,5 mm ± 28,2 for R1 and 149,4 mm ± 36,8 for R2. In the one branch group at the right side the R1average length gave a value of 38,7 mm ± 26,6 instead for the left side gave a value of 28,3 mm ± 23,1. The R1 and R2 were distributed in 2,3 and more secondary branches regarding the motor points location. Finally, I hope with these findings to contribute at the innervation knowledge and the motor point areas from thigh muscles",biometrics;?fruits and seeds characterization;?anthropic actions;?swamps,FOREST,"Universidade Estadual de Montes Claros?Univ Estadual Montes Claros, Dept Biol Geral, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Campos Univ Prof Darcy Ribeiro,Caixa Postal 126, BR-39401089 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil.","Univ Estadual Montes Claros, Dept Biol Geral, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Biol, BR-39401089 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil",
131,Biometrical analysis and selection of tetraploid progenies of Panicum maximum using mixed model methods,Pesquisa Agropecuária Brasileira,2004年4月,18,25,"The objectives of this work were to estimate the genetic and phenotypic parameters and to predict the genetic and genotypic values of the selection candidates obtained from intraspecific crosses in Panicum maximum as well as the performance of the hybrid progeny of the existing and projected crosses. Seventy-nine intraspecific hybrids obtained from artificial crosses among five apomictic and three sexual autotetraploid individuals were evaluated in a clonal test with two replications and ten plants per plot. Green matter yield, total and leaf dry matter yields and leaf percentage were evaluated in five cuts per year during three years. Genetic parameters were estimated and breeding and genotypic values were predicted using the restricted maximum likelihood/best linear unbiased prediction procedure (REML/BLUP). The dominant genetic variance was estimated by adjusting the effect of full-sib families. Low magnitude individual narrow sense heritabilities (0.02-0.05), individual broad sense heritabilities (0.14-0.20) and repeatability measured on an individual basis (0.15-0.21) were obtained. Dominance effects for all evaluated characteristics indicated that breeding strategies that explore heterosis must be adopted. Less than 5% increase in the parameter repeatability was obtained for a three-year evaluation period and may be the criterion to determine the maximum number of years of evaluation to be adopted, without compromising gain per cycle of selection. The identification of hybrid candidates for future cultivars and of those that can be incorporated into the breeding program was based on the genotypic and breeding values, respectively. The prediction of the performance of the hybrid progeny, based on the breeding values of the progenitors, permitted the identification of the best crosses and indicated the best parents to use in crosses.",pineapple-of-gomo;?IAA oxidase;?micropropagation;?plant anatomy,GROWTH;?REGENERATION;?PEROXIDASE;?EXPLANTS;?OXIDASE;?STRESS;?ACID,"Universidade Estadual Paulista?Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Quim & Bioquim, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.","?Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Quim & Bioquim, Botucatu, SP, Brazil",

The objective of this study is to complement the data collected in previous researchs being studied the possible biometrical relation between the cephalic index, the cerebellar fossa, clivus and the basilar artery in the studied specimens. This research was made in the available brains in the anatomy laboratories and data base of our department and that corresponds to our field. The statistics calculus were made using the computational Program Prism 2.3, square analysis of variance, chi and test of Student. In the dolicho- mesocephalic group (DM) the basilar artery (AB) presents-displays a length average of 33.3 mm for a length of clivus of 55.7, wide of the cerebellar fossa of 106.1 mm and height of 44.0 mm.

133,Available tools for the development of a yield model for lenga (Nothofagus pumilio) managed forests along a site quality range,Bosque (Valdivia),2002年7月,16,21,"Lenga forests are the main wood resource in southern Argentina and Chile. It is the most studied native species, with enough information of ecology, biometry and silviculture to define timber prediction and forest management models for regional forest planning. General Forest Planning is designed to achieve a continuous and sustainable supply of logs, but first it is necessary define the land use capability (territorial planning) and determine several timber production alternatives. Therefore, it is necessary to have reliable models that offer adequate information for timber prediction. The aim of this work was to develop a yield model for Nothofagus pumilio along a site quality range based on methodologies and models proposed previously in the literature. To fit a production model, five assumptions were defined (silvicultural system, objectives of forest management, forest growth, yields and livestock browsing), and methodologies and biometric models selected (height growth model, site index classification, DBH growth models, stand density index and thinning level diagrams, rotation length, total volume and timber production of the forest defined along a site quality range). From these models, a silvicultural management system was defined, and their outputs were analyzed from biological and practical use perspectives. This system has five intermediate practices (three thinning levels with secondary products and two thinning levels with timber products) and a final cut. The evolution of a stand without silviculture was also analyzed as control. Finally, the outputs of the forest production model (yields, growth and timber production), over time for different silviculture treatments are presented. The range of timber production varied from 435 m?/ha of logs without bark over 150 years in the best site class to 81 m?/ha over 213 years in a poorest site class.","Forensic dentistry; palate, hard; biometric identification",,,,

In this paper we introduce a generalized edge frequency polygon estimator. Instead of averaging heights of two bins at each bin edge, we take weighted averages of the heights in the neighboring 2k (k greater than or equal to 1) bins, which further reduces the asymptotic mean integrated squared error.

Generally, it is assumed that the genetic and environmental effects are independent and normally distributed. Consequently, the quantitative trait also has a normal distribution. However, there are some situations where the phenotype does not follow the normal distribution. To deal with this problem the author suggests the families of distributions that belong to the Johnson Translation System (JTS).

Staging and biometric assessment with magnetic resonance].,La Radiologia medica,1994年10月,4,23,"In uterine cervical canal carcinoma, the current clinical FIGO criteria often fail not only to differentiate stage IA2 from stage IB but also to demonstrate possible parametrial involvement. Moreover, the analysis of tumor volume and of the depth of neoplastic stromal invasion is not very reliable. The authors investigated MR accuracy in the definition of such variables: to this purpose, 24 patients with histologically confirmed endocervical adenocarcinoma were submitted to MRI, which was performed with an 0.5-T superconductive magnet. Sagittal and oblique transverse or sometimes coronal SE images, oriented so as to be perpendicular to longitudinal cervical major axis were obtained with T2 weighting (TR 1800 ms, TE 25-90 ms). MR data were correlated with pathologic findings. MR accuracy in demonstrating parametrial involvement was 92%, its sensitivity was 86% and specificity 97%. Volumetric MR data showed a high correlation (r = 0.970) with those derived from pathologic findings. In 92% of cases stromal invasion exceeded 5 mm. MRI, thanks to its high accuracy, should be included in diagnostic pretreatment protocols, even though FIGO criteria do not require it yet, especially in the presence of an endocervical adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the accurate definition of tumor volume can allow less extensive surgery with the same survival rates and fewer complications, which are frequently observed after radical hysterectomy.",body measurement; daily gain; protein concentrate; sugarcane,,"[ 1 ] Universidade Estadual Paulista, Brazil

During November/1988 to October/1989, a total of 403 specimens (189 males and 214 females) were collected with otter-trawl nets in north coast of the Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The animals were measured (carapace width excluding lateral spines = LC! and weighed (wet weight = PE). The empiric points of this relation were fit according to the power function (Y = a.X(b)) for each sex, maturation phases and total of individuals. The relation PE x LC indicates that the mole's growth changes during the ontogenesys from isometric (in juvenile phase) to allometric positive (in adult phase). For the females the growth is isometric in the two phases. The weight grows in a higher proportion than the carapace width variable (allometric positive growth). The data can be grouped in a single equation (PE = 7.85.10(-5).LC(3.14)) for the convertion between the variables there was a greater similarity between the equations obtained far each sex. In spite of this, the males present the fattening grade value (''a'') slightly higher than that of the females, possibly because of the greater size reached in its devellopment. The mean weight of the males is greater than the females one (p &lt; 0.01). In the range 80 proves 90mm the males were more abundant, probably due to the females terminal ecdysis is near this size.
